giorgio by moroder.
when i was fifteen, sixteen, when i started really to play the guitar.
i definitely wanted to become a musician.
it was almost impossible because it was, the dream was so big that.
i didn't see any chance because i was living in a little town.
i was studying and when i finally broke away from school and became musician.
i thought "well, i may have a bit of a chance."
because all i ever wanted to do is music but not only play music but compose music.
at that time, in germany, in 1969-70, they had already discotheques.
so i would take my car and go to a discotheque, sing maybe thirty minutes.
i think i had about 7-8 songs.
i would partially sleep in the car because i didn't want to drive home and that helped me for about almost. two years to survive.
in the beginning, i wanted to do an album with the sounds of the 50s, the sounds of the 60s, of the 70s, and then have a sound of the future.
and i said, "wait a second, i know the synthesizer. why don't i use the synthesizer, which is the sound of the future?"
and i didn't have any idea what to do but i knew i needed a click so we put a click on the 24 track which then was synced to the moog modular.
i knew that it could be a sound of the future but i didn't realize how much impact it would be.
my name is giovanni giorgio, but everybody calls me giorgio.
once you want to free your mind about a concept of harmony and music being correct, you can do whatever you want.
so nobody told me what to do and there was no preconception of what to do.
within.
there are so many things that i don't understand.
there's a world within me that i cannot explain.
many rooms to explore, but the doors look the same.
i am lost, i can't even remember my name.
i've been, for sometime, looking for someone.
i need to know now.
please tell me who i am.

instant crush.
i didn't want to be the one to forget.
i thought of everything i'd never regret.
a little time with you is all that i get.
that’s all we need because it's all we can take.
one thing i never see the same when your 'round.
i don’t believe in him—his lips on the ground.
i wanna take you to that place in the “roche”.
but no one gives us any time anymore.
he ask me once if i'd look in on his dog.
you made an offer for it, then you ran off.
i got this picture of us kids in my head.
and all i hear is the last thing that you said.
"i listened to your problems.
now listen to mine".
i didn't want to anymore, oh oh oh.
and we will never be alone again.
'cause it doesn't happen every day.
kinda counted on you being a friend.
can i give it up or give it away.
now i thought about what i wanna say.
but i never really know where to go.
so i chained myself to a friend.
'cause i know it unlocks like a door.
and we will never be alone again.
'cause it doesn't happen every day.
kinda counted on you being a friend.
can i give it up or give it away.
now i thought about what i wanna say.
but i never really know where to go.
so i chained myself to a friend.
some more again.
it didn't matter what they wanted to see.
he thought he saw someone that looked just like me.
the summer memory that just never dies.
we worked too long and hard to give it no time.
he sees right through me, it's so easy with lies.
cracks in the road that i would try and disguise.
he runs his scissor at the seem in the wall.
he cannot break it down or else he would fall.
one thousand lonely stars hiding in the cold.
take it, i don't wanna sing anymore.
"i listened to your problems.
now listen to mine".
i didn't want to anymore, oh oh oh.
and we will never be alone again.
'cause it doesn't happen every day.
kinda counted on you being a friend.

'cause i know it unlocks like a door...
i don't understand, don't get upset.
i'm not with you.
we’re swimming around,
it's all i do, when i'm with you.
and we will never be alone again.
'cause it doesn't happen every day.

a half-forgotten song.

kiss, suddenly alive.

hunger like a storm.

beyond life you will find your song.
before sound, to be found close your eyes.
and rise higher, still endless thrill.
to the land of love.
beyond love
come alive,
angel eye.
forever watching you and i.
you are the night, you are the ocean.
you are the light behind the cloud.
you are the end and the beginning.
a world where time is not allowed.
there's no such thing as competition.
to find our way we lose control.
remember – love's our only mission.
this is the journey of the soul.
the perfect song is framed with silence.
it speaks of places never seen.
your home's a promise long forgotten.
it is the birthplace of your dreams.
fragments of time.
driving this road down to paradise.
letting the sun light into my eyes.
our only plan is to improvise.
and it’s crystal clear.
that i don’t ever want it to end.
if i had my way i would never leave.
keep building these random memories.
turning our days into melodies.
but since i can’t stay.
i’ll just keep playing back.
these fragments of time.
everywhere i go.
these moments will shine.
familiar faces i’ve never seen.
living the gold and the silver dream.
making me feel like i’m seventeen.
and it’s crystal clear.
that i don’t ever want it to end.
if i had my way i would never leave.
keep building these random memories.
turning our days into melodies.
but since i can’t stay.
i’ll just keep playing back.
these fragments of time.
everywhere i go.
these moments will shine.

hey bob i'm looking at what jack was talking about and it's definitely not a particle that's nearby.
it is a bright object and it's obviously rotating because it's flashing, it's way out in the distance, certainly rotating in a very rhythmic fashion because the flashes come around almost on time. 
as we look back at the earth it's up at about 11 o'clock, about maybe ten or twelve diameters. 
i don't know whether that does you any good, but there's something out there.

last night i had a dream about you.
in this dream i'm dancing right beside you.
and it looked like everyone was having fun.
the kind of feeling i've waited so long.
don't stop, come a little closer.
as we jam the rhythm gets stronger.
there's nothing wrong with just a little, little fun.
we were dancing all night long.
the time is right.
to put my arms around you.
you're feeling right.
you wrap your arms around too.
but suddenly i feel the shining sun.
before i knew it this dream was all gone.
oh, i don't know what to do.
about this dream and you.
i wish this dream comes true.
oh, i don't know what to do.
about this dream and you.
