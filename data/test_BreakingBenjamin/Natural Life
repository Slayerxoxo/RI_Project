hold still.
all of my life.
all of my time.
i don't wanna come back around tonight.
and all that i need.
is serenity.
i don't wanna feel your new disease.
the natural life.
you're born, you die.
the natural life.
you're wrong, you're right.
the natural life.
you're born, you die.
the natural life's a lie.
all of my lies.
swallow your pride.
i don't wanna come back around tonight.
and all that i need.
is serenity.
i don't wanna feel your new disease.
the natural life.
you're born, you die.
the natural life.
you're wrong, you're right.
the natural life.
you're born, you die.
the natural life's a lie.
right.
you're right.
i can never lie.
let me go.
try to find a home.
i can't wait.
try to stay awake.
dead inside.
bothered by the lie.
you're right.
the natural life.
you're born, you die.
the natural life.
you're wrong, you're right.
the natural life.
you're born, you die.
the natural life's a lie.
a lie.
