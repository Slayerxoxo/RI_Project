the light is dead in your eye.
so i'll keep living my life.
i only wanted to try.
to find my way back inside.
my imitation of life.
my litigation of life.
it's something easy to find.
inside the shade of your eye.
out of the ground i rise to grace.
nobody knows it's just a phase.
help me i'm out of breath again.
nobody knows somewhere to make it go away.
phase.
phase.
phase.
phase.
i find it hard to decide.
the way to make up your mind.
your lips are better than mine.
so you can kiss this goodbye.
my imitation of life.
my litigation of life.
it's something easy to find.
inside the shade of your eye.
out of the ground i rise to grace.
nobody knows it's just a phase.
help me i'm out of breath again.
nobody knows somewhere to make it go away.
it's just a phase.
and i can't wait.
phase.
phase.
phase.
i know.
i know.
i know.
it's just a fucking phase.
it's just a fucking phase.
i'm drained time to fake and delay.
watch the penny drop.
let it go up and in drop.
then watch it roll.
let's all mourn till.
i survive inside you.
