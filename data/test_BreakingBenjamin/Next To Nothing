beneath this wave.
i just can't take your breath away.
you cut me down.
you know i'll always be around.
so now i wait.
i know you'll live another day.
come and take my breath away.
look me straight in the face.
cause you know it's over.
growin' colder.
i need something.
leave me next to nothing.
all we ever wanted.
i need something.
leave me next to nothing.
next to nothing.
i cut you down.
i know you'll always be around.
so now you'll wait.
i know you'll live another day.
come and take my breath away.
look me straight in the face.
cause you know it's over.
growin' colder.
i need something.
leave me next to nothing.
all we ever wanted.
i need something.
leave me next to nothing.
next to nothing.
cause you know it's over.
growin' colder.
i need something.
leave me next to nothing.
all we ever wanted.
i need something.
leave me next to nothing.
next to nothing.
