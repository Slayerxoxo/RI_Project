and it's cold, a sign of the season.
'cause you're old, and battered and beaten.
and we'll grow, til we hit the ceiling, yeah.
well i'll be better, get away.

i couldn't imagine anyone else.
i'm off for the weekend.
i couldn't imagine why you would save yourself.
well it's gone and it's not returning.
and your clothes and pictures are burning.
'cause you're old, and battered and beaten.
and we'll grow, til we hit the ceiling, yeah.
well i'll be better, get away.
send a letter, bombs away.
you're covered in my skin.
i couldn't imagine anyone else.
