the day has come to an end.
the sun is over my head.
my polyamorous friend.
you got me in a mess of trouble again.
so.
just when you think that you're all right.
i'm calling out from the inside.
i never hurt anyone.
i never listen at all.
they've come to get me again.
the cloud is over my head.
my polyamorous friend.
you got me in a mess of trouble again.
so.
just when you think that you're all right.
i'm calling out from the inside.
i never hurt anyone.
i never listen at all.
just stay away from the white light.
i'd say your worst side's your best side.
i never hurt anyone.
i never listen at all.
well how do you know.
well how do you know.
well how do you know.
well how do you know.
so.
just when you think that you're all right.
i'm calling out from the inside.
i never hurt anyone.
i never listen at all.
just stay away from the white light.
i'd say your worst side's your best side.
i never hurt anyone.
i never listen at all.
let's go.
