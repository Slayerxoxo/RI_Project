border line,
dead inside.
i don't mind,
falling to pieces.
count me in, violent
let's begin, feeding the sickness.
how do i simplify,
dislocate - the enemy's on the way.
show me what it's like
to dream in black and white,
so i can leave this world tonight.
full of fear,
ever clear.
i'll be here,
fighting forever.
curious,
venomous,
you'll find me
climbing to heaven.
never mind,
turn back time.
you'll be fine, i will get left behind.
show me what it's like
to dream in black and white,
so i can leave this world tonight.
holding on too tight.
breathe the breath of life,
so i can leave this world behind.
it only hurts just once.
they're only broken bones.
hide the hate inside.
oh.
so i can leave this world behind
show me what it's like
to dream in black and white,
so i can leave this world tonight.
holding on too tight.
breathe the breath of life,
so i can leave this world behind.
