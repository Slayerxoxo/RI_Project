come on.
the sun will rise.
another time.
the colors blind.
your virgin eyes.
i'm so inclined.
to make you mine.
you're out of line.
and out of time.
and i float upon a shallow bay.
lift me up until the ground gives way.
i'm a california castaway.
i don't think you wanna fuck with me.
don't over kill.
this painless thrill.
it's bitter still.
your pretty pill.
you wait until.
you've had your fill.
i know you will.
i know you will.
and i float upon a shallow bay.
lift me up until the ground gives way.
i'm a california castaway.
i don't think you wanna fuck with me.
a shallow bay.
a shallow bay.
and i float upon a shallow bay.
lift me up until the ground gives way.
i'm a california castaway.
i don't think you wanna fuck with me.
and i float upon a shallow bay.
lift me up until the ground gives way.
i'm a california castaway.
i don't think you wanna fuck with me.
you live, you learn.
you live, you learn.
you live, you learn.
you live.
