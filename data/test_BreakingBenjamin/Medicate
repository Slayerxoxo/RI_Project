i got somethin' up my sleeve.
i know you will cover me.
inside out and in between.
i know you will cover me.
i've got bruises on my knees.
i know you will cover me.
inside out and in between.
and i know you will cover me.
run away.
make hate.
and get laid.
and get laid.
you tie me up.
i've had enough.
so medicate.
medicate.
i'm already incomplete.
i know you will cover me.
looking by your empathy.
i know you will cover me.
i've been lyin' here for weeks.
i know you will cover me.
inside out and in between.
and i know you will cover me.
run away.
make hate.
and get laid.
and get laid.
you tie me up.
i've had enough.
so medicate.
medicate.
run away.
make hate.
and get laid.
and get laid.
you tie me up.
i've had enough.
so medicate.
medicate.
run away.
make hate.
and get laid.
and get laid.
you tie me up.
i've had enough.
so medicate.
medicate.
