it started again.
claimin' a friend.
i couldn't be.
i've never been.
i'm all alone.
out in the cold.
i'll never know.
your sugarcoat.
you're ready to blow.
you're ready to go.
but i'll never know.
your sugarcoat.
is just as sweet as i am.
look what you did.
suck on your lies 'til your eyes turn red.
what did you say.
willing to drown in a tidal wave.
take me away.
let me believe that you're on your way.
look what you did.
suck on your lies 'til your eyes turn red.
i'm on the floor.
battered and bored.
you got a taste.
i can't ignore.
i'm all alone.
out in the cold.
i'll never know.
your sugarcoat.
you're ready to blow.
you're ready to go.
but i'll never know.
your sugarcoat.
is just as sweet as i am.
look what you did.
suck on your lies 'til your eyes turn red.
what did you say.
willing to drown in a tidal wave.
take me away.
let me believe that you're on your way.
look what you did.
suck on your lies 'til your eyes turn red.
look what you did.
suck on your lies 'til your eyes turn red.
what did you say.
willing to drown in a tidal wave.
take me away.
let me believe that you're on your way.
look what you did.
suck on your lies 'til your eyes turn red.
red.
your eyes are red.
