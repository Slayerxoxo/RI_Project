shove me under you again.
i can't wait for this to end.
sober, empty in the head.
i know i can never win.
why should i have to wait.
i'll just look the other way.
we left this land of shiny lights.
i wish i may, i wish i might.
when all these dreams have come to end.
you wish you were, you're not my friend.
i can see you suffocate.
i can find no other way.
try to make you saturate.
i can be your enemy.
why should i have to wait.
i'll just look the other way.
we left this land of shiny lights.
i wish i may, i wish i might.
when all these dreams have come to end.
you wish you were, you're not my friend.
woah no.
we left this land of shiny lights.
i wish i may, i wish i might.
when all these dreams have come to end.
you wish you were, you're not my friend.
you said you'd love.
to see the end.
the long hard road.
that i have been.
when all these dreams have come to end.
you wish you were, you're not my friend.
blind eyes shine bright.
