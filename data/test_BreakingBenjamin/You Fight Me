you fight me, flat on my lonely face i fell.
finding in the end i live well.
in light of the life that i have found,
it's coming down.
i don't know what isn't real,
but it's easy
to beat me.
suck it in.
life is sink or swim.
love is blinding, no surviving.
i don't know what i want to be yet.
but i can show that i need to see this.
no time for lies and empty fights.
i'm on your side.
can we live a life of peace and happiness.
i don't think so.
no denying i am scared to lose the things i love.
i'm in control.
this is how, this is how it's going to end.
this is how, this is how it's going to end.
end.
everyone is waiting here for everyone.
leave me alone.
this is how, this is how it's going to end.
this is how, this is how it's going to end.
this is how, this is how it's going to end.
no.
this is how, this is how it's going to end.
