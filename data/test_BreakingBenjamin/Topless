fruit on the vine.
you've got yours,
and i've got mine.
meat on your bones.
they won't know, they won't know.
i loathe your face, just get away.
i'm on my knees, fuck you, fuck me.
i'm on my way to feel you dislocate.
safe in your space.
i'm open, wide open.
i loathe your face, just get away.
i'm on my knees, fuck you, fuck me.
like me, like me, like me.
i loathe your face, just get away.
i'm on my knees, fuck you, fuck me.
me, me, me.
