what's all this talk of a notion.
i'd rather drink from the ocean.
what did you mean when you said no.
i only want what is best for you.
but i won't ever let you drown.
no i won't ever let you down.
cause i am my enemy.
the water's up to the knee.
i never wanted nothin' from you.
yes i do, yes i do.
my engine's runnin' on dry.
my head's so fucked up inside.
shut up.
i know.
i said so.
there is no way to recover.
you told me there is no other.
the surface is getting hotter.
i'll shove your head under water.
but i won't ever let you drown.
no i won't ever let you down.
cause i am my enemy.
the water's up to the knee.
i never wanted nothin' from you.
yes i do, yes i do.
my engine's runnin' on dry.
my head's so fucked up inside.
shut up.
i know.
i said so.
cause i am my enemy.
the water's up to the knee.
i never wanted nothin' from you.
yes i do, yes i do.
my engine's runnin' on dry.
my head's so fucked up inside.
shut up.
i know.
i said so.
cause i am my enemy.
the water's up to the knee.
i never wanted nothin' from you.
yes i do, yes i do.
my engine's runnin' on dry.
my head's so fucked up inside.
shut up.
i know.
i said so.
