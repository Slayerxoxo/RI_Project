milk it for all it's worth.
make sure you get there first.
the apple of your eye.
the rotten core inside.
we are all prisoners.
things couldn't get much worse.
i've had it up to here, you know your end is near.
you had to have it all,
well have you had enough.
you greedy little bastard,
you will get what you deserve.
when all is said and done,
i will be the one to leave you in the misery and hate what you've become.
intoxicated eyes, no longer live that life.
you should have learned by now, i'll burn this whole world down.
i need some peace of mind, no fear of what's behind.
you think you've won this fight, you've only lost your mind.
you had to have it all,
well have you had enough.
you greedy little bastard,
you will get what you deserve.
when all is said and done,
i will be the one to leave you in the misery and hate what you've become.
hold me down i will live again.
pull me out i will break it in.
hold me down better in the end.
hold me down.
you had to have it all,
well have you had enough.
you greedy little bastard,
you will get what you deserve.
when all is said and done,
i will be the one to leave you in the misery and hate what you've become.
heaven help you.
