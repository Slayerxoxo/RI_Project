i've got a little red bow.
and i bought it for you.
'cause i know you're not fair.
i don't get it, oh well.
and you color my skin.
and the colors don't blend.
'cause i'm gonna get you.
and your little dog too.
there's a yellow brick road.
that we follow back home.
'cause i know you can't wait.
your belligerent hate.
there's no place like home.
there's no place like home.
like home.
i've, got a southern belle too.
and ruby red shoes.
with a body of straw.
are you sick of it all.
there's a man made of tin.
with an oil can grin.
and i'm gonna get you.
and your little dog too.
there's a yellow brick road.
that we follow back home.
and i know you can't wait.
your belligerent hate.
there's no place like home.
there's no place like home.
there's a little white porch.
and you wanted it so.
can you let me go down.
to the end of the road.
in the black and the white.
a technicolorful life.
can i stand by your side.
we can make it alright.
like home.
'cause i'm home.
there's a little white porch.
and you wanted it so.
can you let me go down.
to the end of the road.
in the black and the white.
a technicolorful life.
then another arrived.
it's a cowardly lion.
what i want from this world.
what i wanna resolve.
when i want you to stay.
so i want you to wait.
i don't wanna be bold.
i don't wanna be cold.
i don't wanna grow old.
i don't wanna go home.
