keys to the kingdom.
no control! no surprise!
tossed the keys to the kingdom down that hole in my eye.
i'm my own casualty! i fuck up everything i see, fighting in futility!
it's our final war.
tell me what's worth fighting for.
when we know there's nothing more.
take the hand or fist.
just to sell ourselves for this.
the path we least resist.
no control! no surprise!
tossed the keys to the kingdom down that hole in my eye.
i'm my own casualty! i fuck up everything i see, fighting in futility!
uh, i give you what you came for.
this is not the same though.
got a different method.
but i still can bring the pain so.
not all give the same flow.
i got daddy's saying low.
i ain't shock and get you.
never really in my range, though.
somehow they ain't grow.
half fried bango.
all primetime.

aiming at my name though.
careful what you shoot because you might hit what you aim for.
(careful what you shoot because you might hit what you aim for).
no control! no surprise!
tossed the keys to the kingdom down that hole in my eye.
i'm my own casualty! i fuck up everything i see, fighting in futility.
no control! no surprise!
tossed the keys to the kingdom down that hole in my eye.
i'm my own casualty!
i'm not allowed to say certain things, aahhhh!!
try and do....try and do the other thing... real quick.
all for nothing.
yeah.
uh.
so whatcha waiting for?
anticipating more.
why you debate what it can take to instigate a war?
yeah i've been hating on the time i wasn't hated for.
there's nothing they can fucking say they didn't say before.
but you could never see it, your battle's not mine.
wanna skate and play it safe but this is take a shot time.
you're waiting for a purpose, i already got mine.
while you tell me step to it like 1, 2, 3, 4!
and if i do what you demand.
you say.
you'll let me understand.
you say.
you're gonna hold me to your word.
and if i sell myself away.

our trust betrayed all for nothing.
all for nothing.

you're talk, but let me show you where to put your paranoia.
your're joking i don't have a half a sucker bone to throw yah.
i'm disgusted wonder what's gonna make you tuck your tail below ya.
and no i'm not your soldier, i'm not taking any orders.
i'm a five star general infantry controller, need a lesson, let me show you.

our trust betrayed all for nothing.
all for nothing.
all for nothing.
all for... oh oh oh oh 
war.
one, two, one, two, thank you!
there's no peace,
only war.
victory decides who's wrong or right.
it will not cease,
only grow,
you better be prepared to fight!
and it will not apologize.
for laying down your life.
war,
there's no pain,
it will spare.
fear has become your only right.
and once you're lost,
in your despair,
forever black, eternal night.
and it will not apologize.
for laying down your life.
war destroy you
war destroy you.
it needs no side to justify.
laying down your life.
war destroyer war.
wastelands.
this is war with no weapons,
marching with no stepping,
murder with no killing,
illing every direction.
first, no sequel,
do the math, no equal.
john with no yoko.
more power, less people.
and no i'm not afraid of that.
print in your paperback.
every rap is made in fact.
to act as a delayed attack.
every phrase a razor blade.
that's saved until they play it back.
to slay and leave 'em laying on the pavement.
bang, fade to black.
in the wastelands of today,
when there's nothing left to lose,
and and there's nothing more to take,
but you force yourself to choose,
in the wastelands of today,
when tomorrow disappears.
when the future slips away,
and your hope turns into fear,
in the wastelands of today.
roll credits, to get it,
the show's done,
they're talking for just talking,
but meaning they got none,
none of 'em come proper,
they talk like a shotgun,
but how many got bred with integrity,
not one, 
so no, i'm not afraid to see these suckers hold a blade to me.
ain't a way to shake the ground i built before you came to be.
take it how you take it, i'm the opposite of vacancy.
and this is not negotiation, y'all can hate and.
and wait and see...
in the wastelands of today.
when there's nothing left to lose.
and and there's nothing more to take.
but you force yourself to choose.
in the wastelands of today.
when tomorrow disappears.
when the future slips away.
and your hope turns into fear.
and your hope turns into fear.
in the wastelands of today!
in the wastelands of today.
when there's nothing left to lose.
and and there's nothing more to take.
but you force yourself to choose.
in the wastelands of today.
when tomorrow disappear.
when the future slips away.
and your hope turns into fear.
and your hope turns into fear.
in the wastelands of today!
in the wastelands of today!
in the wastelands of today!
until it’s gone.
a fire needs a space to burn.
a breath to build a glow.
i've heard it said a thousand times.
but now i know.
that you don't know what you've got.
oh you don't know what you've got.
no you don't know what you've got.
until it's gone
until it's gone
until it's gone.
i thought i kept you safe and sound.
i thought i made you strong.
but something made me realize.
that i was wrong.
'cause finding what you got sometimes.
means finding it alone.
and i can finally see your light.
when i let go.
'cause you don't know what you've got.
until it's gone
until it's gone
until it's gone
until it's gone
until it's gone
until it's gone
until it's gone
until it's gone.
'cause you don't know what you've got.
oh you don't know what you've got.
no you don't know what you've got.
it's your battle to be fought.
no you don't know what you've got.
'til it's gone
'til it's gone
'til it's gone.
rebellion.
i've seen the blood.
i've seen the broken.
the lost and the sights unseen.
i want a flood
i want an ocean.
to wash my confusion clean.
i can't resolve this empty story.
i can't repair the damage done.
we are the fortunate ones.
who've never faced oppression's gun.
we are the fortunate ones.
imitations of rebellion.
we act it out.
we wear the colors.
confined by the things we own.
we're not without.
we're like each other.
pretending we're here alone.
and far away, they burn their buildings.
right in the face of the damage done.
we are the fortunate ones.
who've never faced oppression's gun.
we are the fortunate ones.
imitations of rebellion.
rebellion, rebellion.
we lost before the start.
rebellion, rebellion.
one by one we fall apart.
we are the fortunate ones.
who've never faced oppression's gun.
we are the fortunate ones.
imitations of imitations of...
we are the fortunate ones.
who've never faced oppression's gun.
we are the fortunate ones.
imitations of rebellion.
mark the graves.
there's a fragile game we play.
with the ghosts of yesterday.
if we can't let go, we'll never say goodbye.
no trace of what remains.
no stones to mark the graves.
only memories we thought we could deny.
there was so much more to lose.
than the pain i put you through.
in my carelessness i left you in the dark.
and the blood may wash away.
but the scars will never fade.
at least i know somehow i made a mark.
in the dark
in the light
nothing left
nothing right.
in the dark
in the light
nothing left
nothing right.
in the dark

nothing left
nothing right.
in the dark

guilty all the same.
tell us all again.
what you think we should be.
what the answers are.
what it is we can't see.
tell us all again.
how to do what you say.
how to fall in line.
how there's no other way.
but oh, we all know.
you're guilty all the same.
too sick to be ashamed.
you want to point your finger.
but there's no one else to blame.
you're guilty all the same.
too sick to be ashamed.
you want to point your finger.
but there's no one else to blame.
you're guilty all the same.
show us all again.
that our hands are unclean.
that we're unprepared.
that you have what we need.
show us all again.
'cause we cannot be saved.
'cause the end is near.
now there's no other way.
and oh, you will know.
you're guilty all the same.

yeah, you already know what it is.
can y'all explain what kind of land is this when a man has plans of being rich.
but the bosses plans is wealthy?
dirty money scheme, a clean split is nonsense.
it's insane
even corporate hands is filthy.
they talk team and take the paper route.
all they think about is bank accounts, assets and realty.
at anybody's expense,
no shame with a clear conscience.
no regrets and guilt free,
they claim that ain't the way that they built me.
the smoke screen before the flame.
knowing as soon as the dough or the deal peak.
they say it's time for things to change.
re-arrange like good product re-built cheap.
anything if it's more to gain.
drained, manipulated like artists, it's real deep.
until no more remains, but i'm still me.
like authentic hip-hop and rock,
'til pop and radio and record companies killed me.
try to force me to stray and obey.
and got the gall to say how real can real be.
you feel me, we'll see that green could be to blame.
or greedy for the fame,
tv or a name
the media, the game,
to me you're all the same.
you're guilty
you're guilty all the same.
too sick to be ashamed.
you want to point your finger.
but there's no one else to blame.
you're guilty all the same.
too sick to be ashamed.

final masquerade.
tearing me apart with words you wouldn't say,
and suddenly tomorrow's a moment washed away.
'cause i don't have a reason, and you don't have the time,
but we both keep on waiting for something we won't find.
the light on the horizon was brighter yesterday,
with shadows floating over, the scars begin to fade.
we said it was forever but then it slipped away,
standing at the end of the final masquerade.
the final masquerade!
all i ever wanted, the secrets that you keep,
all you've ever wanted, the truth i couldn't speak.
'cause i can't see forgiveness, and you can't see the crime,
and we both keep on waiting for what we left behind.
the light on the horizon was brighter yesterday,
with shadows floating over, the scars begin to fade.
we said it was forever but then it slipped away,
standing at the end of the final masquerade.
the final masquerade!
the final masquerade!
standing at the end of the final masquerade!
the light on the horizon was brighter yesterday,

a line in the sand.
today, we stood on the wall,
we laughed at the sun, we laughed at the guns,
we laughed at it all.
and when they, they told us to go,
we paid them no mind, like every other time,
but little did we know...
today, i look for a sign,
with flames in my hands,
a line in the sand,
between yours and mine,
and it came, like fire from below,
your greed led the call,
my flag had to fall,
but little did you know.
another day, your truth will come,
you're gonna pay for what you,
pay for what you've done,
you'll get what's yours,
and face your fraud,
you're gonna give me back what's mine.
give me back what's mine!
i ain't never been a coward,
i ain't never seen blood,
you had sold me an ocean.
and i was lost in the flood,
we were counting on a leader.
we were driven by need,
couldn't take temptation.
and we were blinded by greed,
you were steady as a sniper.
we were waiting on a wire,
so we never saw it coming.
when you ran from the fire,
you can try intimidation.
or you can try to ignore,
but when the time comes calling.
yeah! you are gonna get yours!
another day, your truth will come,
you're gonna pay for what you.
pay for what you've done,
you'll get what's yours.
and face your fraud,
you're gonna give me back what's mine
give me back what's mine!
and so today, your truth has come,
you're gonna pay for what you.
pay for what you've done,
you'll get what's yours.
you're out of time,
and you will give me back what's mine.
give me, give me back what's mine!
give me, give me back what's mine!
what's mine, give me, give me back what's mine!
what's mine!
what's mine!
give me back what's mine!
today, we stood on the wall,
we laughed at the sun, we laughed at the guns,
we laughed at it all.
and when they, they told us to go,

papercut.
why does it feel like night today?
something in here's not right today.
why am i so uptight today?
paranoia's all i got left.
i don't know what stressed me first.
or how the pressure was fed.
but i know just what it feels like.
to have a voice in the back of my head.
like a face that i hold inside.
a face that awakes when i close my eyes.
a face that watches every time i lie.
a face that laughs every time i fall.
(and watches everything)
so i know that when it's time to sink or swim.
that the face inside is hearing me.
right beneath my skin.
it's like i'm paranoid lookin' over my back.
it's like a whirlwind inside of my head.
it's like i can't stop what i'm hearing within.
it's like the face inside is right beneath my skin.
i know i've got a face in me.
points out all my mistakes to me.
you've got a face on the inside too.
your paranoia's probably worse.
i don't know what set me off first.
but i know what i can't stand.
everybody acts like the fact of the matter is.
i can't add up to what you can but.
everybody has a face that they hold inside.
a face that awakes when i close my eyes.
a face that watches every time they lie.
a face that laughs every time they fall.
(and watches everything).
so you know that when it's time to sink or swim.
that the face inside is watching you too.
right inside your skin.
it's like i'm paranoid lookin' over my back.
it's like a whirlwind inside of my head.
it's like i can't stop what i'm hearing within.
it's like the face inside is right beneath my skin.

the face inside is right beneath your skin.
the face inside is right beneath your skin.
the sun goes down.
i feel the light betray me.
the sun goes down.

one step closer.
i cannot take this anymore.
saying everything i've said before.
all these words they make no sense.
i find bliss in ignorance.
less i hear the less you'll say.
you'll find that out anyway.
just like before.
everything you say to me.
takes me one step closer to the edge.
and i'm about to break.
i need a little room to breathe.
cause i'm one step closer to the edge.
i'm about to break.
i find the answers aren't so clear.
wish i could find a way to disappear.
all these thoughts they make no sense.
i find bliss in ignorance.
nothing seems to go away.
over and over again
just like before...
everything you say to me.
takes me one step closer to the edge.
and i'm about to break.
i need a little room to breathe.

shut up when i'm talking to you.
shut up, shut up, shut up
shut up when i'm talking to you.
shut up, shut up, shut up, shut up.
i'm about to break.

with you.
i woke up in a dream today.
to the cold of the static and put my cold feet on the floor.
forgot all about yesterday.
remembering i’m pretending to be where i’m not anymore.
a little taste of hypocrisy.
and i’m left in the wake of the mistake, slow to react.
so even though you’re so close to me.
you’re still so distant and i can’t bring you back.
it’s true the way i feel.
was promised by your face.
the sound of your voice.
painted on my memories.
even if you’re not with me.

i hit you and you hit me back.
we fall to the floor, the rest of the day stands still.
fine line between this and that.
when things go wrong i pretend the past isn’t real.
now i'm trapped in this memory.
and i’m left in the wake of the mistake, slow to react.
so even though you’re close to me.

crawling in my skin.
these wounds they will not heal.
fear is how i fall.
confusing what is real.
there's something inside me that pulls beneath the surface.
consuming, confusing.
this lack of self-control i fear is never ending.
controlling. i can't seem...
to find myself again.
my walls are closing in.
(without a sense of confidence and i'm convinced that there's just too much pressure to take)
i've felt this way before.
so insecure
crawling in my skin.
these wounds they will not heal.
fear is how i fall.
confusing what is real.
discomfort endlessly has pulled itself upon me.
distracting, reacting
against my will i stand beside my own reflection.
it's haunting how i can't seem...
to find myself again
my walls are closing in.

graffiti decorations.
under a sky of dust
a constant wave of tension.
on top of broken trust
the lessons that you taught me.
i learn were never true.
now i find myself in question.
(they point the finger at me again)
guilty by association.
(you point the finger at me again)
i wanna run away
never say goodbye
i wanna know the truth.
instead of wondering why
i wanna know the answers.
no more lies
i wanna shut the door.
and open up my mind.
paper bags and angry voices
under a sky of dust
another wave of tension.
has more than filled me up.
all my talk of taking action
these words were never true.
now i find myself in question
(they point the finger at me again)

and open up my mind 
by myself.
what do i do to ignore them behind me?
do i follow my instincts blindly?
do i hide my pride from these bad dreams?
and give in to sad thoughts that are maddening?
do i sit here and try to stand it?
or do i try to catch them red-handed?
do i trust some and get fooled by phoniness,
or do i trust nobody and live in loneliness?
because i can't hold on when i'm stretched so thin.
i make the right moves but i'm lost within.
i put on my daily facade but then.
i just end up getting hurt again.
by myself
i ask why, but in my mind.
i find i can’t rely on myself.
i ask why, but in my mind.
i find i can’t rely on myself.
i can’t hold on.
to what i want when i’m stretched so thin.
it’s all too much to take in.
i can’t hold on.
to anything watching everything spin.
with thoughts of failure sinking in.
if i
turn my back i’m defenseless
and to go blindly seems senseless.
if i hide my pride and let it all go on then they’ll.
take from me ‘till everything is gone.
if i let them go i’ll be outdone.
but if i try to catch them i’ll be outrun.
if i’m killed by the questions like a cancer.
then i’ll be buried in the silence of the answer.
by myself
i ask why, but in my mind.

how do you expect... i will know what to do.
when all i know is what you tell me to.
don’t you know
i can’t tell you how to make it go.
no matter what i do, how hard i try.
i can’t seem to convince myself why.
i’m stuck on the outside.
don’t you know
i can’t tell you how to make it go.
no matter what i do, how hard i try.
i can’t seem to convince myself why.
i’m stuck on the outside.
i can’t hold on
to what i want when i’m stretched so thin.
it’s all too much to take in.
i can’t hold on
to anything watching everything spin.
with thoughts of failure sinking in.

in the end.
(it starts with one)
one thing i don't know why.
it doesn’t even matter how hard you try.
keep that in mind, i designed this rhyme.
to explain in due time.
(all i know)
time is a valuable thing.
watch it fly by as the pendulum swings.
watch it count down to the end of the day.
the clock ticks life away.
(it’s so unreal)
didn’t look out below.
watch the time go right out the window.
trying to hold on but didn’t even know.
i wasted it all just to watch you go.
i kept everything inside and even though i tried, it all fell apart.
what it meant to be will eventually be a memory of a time when...
i tried so hard.
and got so far
but in the end.
it doesn't even matter.
i had to fall.
to lose it all
but in the end.
it doesn't even matter.
one thing, i don’t know why
it doesn’t even matter how hard you try.
keep that in mind, i designed this rhyme.
to remind myself how.
i tried so hard.
in spite of the way you were mocking me.
acting like i was part of your property.
remembering all the times you fought with me.
i’m surprised it got so (far).
things aren’t the way they were before.
you wouldn’t even recognize me anymore.
not that you knew me back then.
but it all comes back to me.
in the end
you kept everything inside and even though i tried, it all fell apart.
what it meant to me will eventually be a memory of a time when...
i tried so hard.
and got so far
but in the end.
it doesn’t even matter.
i had to fall.
to lose it all.
but in the end.
it doesn’t even matter.
i've put my trust in you
pushed as far as i can go.
for all this
there’s only one thing you should know.
i've put my trust in you.
pushed as far as i can go.
for all this
there’s only one thing you should know.
i tried so hard

a place for my head.
i watch how the moon sits in the sky in the dark night.
shining with the light from the sun.
and the sun doesn't give light to the moon assuming.
the moon’s gonna owe it one.
it makes me think of how you act for me.
you do favors and then rapidly.
you just turn around and start asking me.
about things that you want back from me.
i’m sick of the tension, sick of the hunger.
sick of you acting like i owe you this.
find another place to feed your greed.
while i find a place to rest.
i want to be in another place.
i hate when you say you don’t understand.
(you’ll see it's not meant to be)
i want to be in the energy, not with the enemy.
a place for my head.
maybe someday i’ll be just like you.
and step on people like you do and.
run away of the people i thought i knew.
i remember back then who you were.
you used to be calm, used to be strong.
used to be generous but you should’ve known.
that you’d wear out your welcome.
and now you see how quiet it is, all alone.
i’m sick of the tension, sick of the hunger.
sick of you acting like i owe you this.
find another place to feed your greed.
while i find a place to rest.
i’m so sick of the tension, sick of the hunger.
sick of you acting like i owe you this.
find another place to feed your greed.
while i find a place to rest.
i want to be in another place.
i hate when you say you don't understand.
(you'll see it's not meant to be)
i want to be in the energy, not with the enemy.
a place for my head.
you try to take the best of me.
go away
you try to take the best of me.
go away

i want to be in the energy, not with the enemy.
a place for my head.
shut up....what!
i’m so sick of the tension (shut)
sick of the hunger.
sick of you acting like i owe you this.
find another place to feed your greed (up).
while i find a place to rest.
i’m so sick of the tension (what).
sick of the hunger.
sick of you acting like i owe you this.
find another place to feed your greed (stay away from me).
while i find a place to rest.
forgotten.
from the top to the bottom.
bottom to top i stop.
at the core i’ve forgotten.
in the middle of my thoughts.
taken far from my safety.
the picture is there.
the memory won’t escape me.
but why should i care.
from the top to the bottom.
bottom to top i stop.
at the core i’ve forgotten.
in the middle of my thoughts.
taken far from my safety.
the picture is there.
the memory won’t escape me.
but why should i care.
there’s a place so dark you can’t see the end.
skies cock back and shock that which can’t defend.
the rain then sends dripping / an acidic question.
forcefully, the power of suggestion.
then with the eyes shut / looking thought the rust and rot.
and dust / a small spot of light floods the floor.
and pours over the rusted world of pretend.
the eyes ease open and its dark again.
from the top to the bottom.
bottom to top i stop.
at the core i’ve forgotten.
in the middle of my thoughts.
taken far from my safety.
the picture is there.
the memory won’t escape me.
but why should i care.
in the memory you’ll find me.
eyes burning up.
the darkness holding me tightly.
until the sun rises up.
moving all around / screaming of the ups and downs.
pollution manifested in perpetual sound.
the wheels go round and the sunset creeps behind.
street lamps, chain-link and concrete.
a little piece of paper with a picture drawn floats.
on down the street till the wind is gone.
the memory now is like the picture was then.
when the paper’s crumpled up it can’t be perfect again.
from the top to the bottom.
bottom to top i stop.
at the core i’ve forgotten.
in the middle of my thoughts.
taken far from my safety.
the picture is there.

cure for the itch.
folks, we have a very special guest for you tonight.
i'd like to introduce...
mr. hahn!
let's hear it for the great mr. hahn!
and now a lesson in rhythm management.
let's begin...
alright now, wasn't that fun?
let's try something else.
pushing me away.
i've lied to you
the same way that i always do.
this is the last smile
that i'll fake for the sake of being with you.
(everything falls apart.
even the people who never frown.
eventually break down)
the sacrifice of hiding in a lie.
(everything has to end
you'll soon find we're out of time left.
to watch it all unwind)
the sacrifice is never knowing.
why i never walked away.
why i played myself this way.
now i see you're testing me pushes me away.
why i never walked away.
why i played myself this way.
now i see your testing me pushes me away.
i've tried like you.
to do everything you wanted too.
this is the last time.
i'll take the blame for the sake of being with you.

pushes me away.
numb.
i'm tired of being what you want me to be.
feeling so faithless, lost under the surface.
don't know what you're expecting of me.
put under the pressure of walking in your shoes.
(caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow).
every step that i take is another mistake to you.
(caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow).
i've become so numb, i can't feel you there.
become so tired, so much more aware.
i'm becoming this, all i want to do.
is be more like me and be less like you.
can't you see that you're smothering me,
holding too tightly, afraid to lose control?
'cause everything that you thought i would be.
has fallen apart right in front of you.
(caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow).
every step that i take is another mistake to you.
(caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow).
and every second i waste is more than i can take.
i've become so numb, i can't feel you there,
become so tired, so much more aware.
i'm becoming this, all i want to do.
is be more like me and be less like you.
and i know
i may end up failing too.
but i know
you were just like me with someone disappointed in you.
i've become so numb, i can't feel you there,
become so tired, so much more aware.
i'm becoming this, all i want to do.
is be more like me and be less like you.
i've become so numb, i can't feel you there.
(i'm tired of being what you want me to be).
i've become so numb, i can't feel you there.
(i'm tired of being what you want me to be).

from the inside.
i don’t know who to trust no surprise.
(everyone feels so far away from me).
heavy thoughts sift through dust and the lies.
(trying not to break but i’m so tired of this deceit).
(every time i try to make myself get back up on my feet).
(all i ever think about is this).
(all the tiring time between).
(and how trying to put my trust in you just takes so much out of me).
take everything from the inside and throw it all away.
cuz i swear for the last time i won’t trust myself with you.
tension is building inside steadily.
(everyone feels so far away from me).
heavy thoughts forcing their way out of me.
(trying not to break but i’m so tired of this deceit).
(every time i try to make myself get back up on my feet).
(all i ever think about is this).
(all the tiring time between).
(and how trying to put my trust in you just takes so much out of me).
take everything from the inside and throw it all away.
cuz i swear for the last time i won’t trust myself with you.
i won’t waste myself on you.
you
you
waste myself on you.
you
you
i’ll take everything from the inside and throw it all away.
cuz i swear for the last time i won’t trust myself with you.
everything from the inside and just throw it all away.
cuz i swear for the last time i won’t trust myself with you.
you
you 
breaking the habit.
memories consume
like opening the wound.
i'm picking me apart again.
you all assume
i'm safe here in my room.
unless i try to start again.
i don't want to be the one.
the battles always choose.
'cause inside i realize.
that i'm the one confused.
i don't know what's worth fighting for.
or why i have to scream.
i don't know why i instigate.
and say what i don't mean.
i don't know how i got this way.
i know it's not alright.
so i'm breaking the habit,
i'm breaking the habit.
tonight
clutching my cure.
i tightly lock the door.
i try to catch my breath again.
i hurt much more.
than anytime before.
i had no options left again.
i don't want to be the one.
the battles always choose.
'cause inside i realize.
that i'm the one confused.
i don't know what's worth fighting for.
or why i have to scream.
i don't know why i instigate.
and say what i don't mean.
i don't know how i got this way.
i'll never be alright.
so i'm breaking the habit,
i'm breaking the habit.
tonight
i'll paint it on the walls.
'cause i'm the one at faults.
i'll never fight again.
and this is how it ends.
i don't know what's worth fighting for.
or why i have to scream.
but now i have some clarity.
to show you what i mean.
i don't know how i got this way.
i'll never be alright.
so, i'm breaking the habit.
i'm breaking the habit.
i’m breaking the habit.
tonight 
somewhere i belong.
(when this began)
i had nothing to say.
and i get lost in the nothingness inside of me.
(i was confused)
and i let it all out to find.
that i’m not the only person with these things in mind.
(inside of me)
but all that they can see the words revealed.
is the only real thing that i’ve got left to feel.
(nothing to lose)
just stuck, hollow and alone.
and the fault is my own, and the fault is my own.
i wanna heal, i wanna feel what i thought was never real.
i wanna let go of the pain i’ve felt so long.
(erase all the pain till it’s gone)
i wanna heal, i wanna feel like i’m close to something real.
i wanna find something i’ve wanted all along.
somewhere i belong
and i’ve got nothing to say.
i can’t believe i didn’t fall right down on my face.
(i was confused)
looking everywhere only to find.
that it’s not the way i had imagined it all in my mind.
(so what am i)
what do i have but negativity.
’cause i can’t justify the way, everyone is looking at me.
(nothing to lose)
nothing to gain, hollow and alone.
and the fault is my own, and the fault is my own.
i wanna heal, i wanna feel what i thought was never real.
i wanna let go of the pain i’ve felt so long.
(erase all the pain till it’s gone).
i wanna heal, i wanna feel like i’m close to something real.
i wanna find something i’ve wanted all along.
somewhere i belong.
i will never know myself until i do this on my own.
and i will never feel anything else, until my wounds are healed.
i will never be anything till i break away from me.
i will break away, i'll find myself today.
i wanna heal, i wanna feel what i thought was never real.
i wanna let go of the pain i’ve felt so long.
(erase all the pain till it’s gone)
i wanna heal, i wanna feel like i’m close to something real.
i wanna find something i’ve wanted all along.
somewhere i belong
i wanna heal, i wanna feel like i’m somewhere i belong.
i wanna heal, i wanna feel like i’m somewhere i belong.
somewhere i belong
don't stay.
sometimes i need to remember just to breathe.
sometimes i need you to stay away from me.
sometimes i’m in disbelief i didn’t know.
somehow i need you to go.
don’t stay
forget our memories.
forget our possibilities.
what you were changing me into.
just give me myself back and.
don’t stay
forget our memories.
forget our possibilities.
take all your faithlessness with you.
just give me myself back and.

somehow i need to be alone.

lying from you.
when i pretend everything is what i want it to be.
i look exactly like what you had always wanted to see.
when i pretend, i can’t forget about the criminal i am.
stealing second after second just cause i know i can but.
i can’t pretend this is the way it’ll stay i’m just.
(trying to bend the truth)
i can’t pretend i’m who you want me to be, so i’m.
(lying my way from you).
no no turning back now.
(i wanna be pushed aside so let me go).
no no turning back now.
(let me take back my life,i’d rather be all alone).
no turning back now.
(anywhere on my own cause i can see).
no no turning back now.
(the very worst part of you is me).

i remember what they taught to me.
remember condescending talk of who i ought to be.
remember listening to all of that and this again.
so i pretended up a person who was fittin’ in.
and now you think this person really is me and i’m.
(trying to bend the truth).
but the more i push the more i'm pulling away 'cause i'm.
(lying my way from you).
no no turning back now.
(i wanna be pushed aside so let me go).
no no turning back now.
(let me take back my life i’d rather be all alone).
no turning back now.
(anywhere on my own cause i can see).
no no turning back now.
(the very worst part of you).
(the very worst part of you is me).
this isn’t what i wanted to be, i never thought that what i said would.
have you running from me.
like this
this isn’t what i wanted to be, i never thought that what i said would.

hit the floor.
there are just too many times that people have tried to look inside of me.
wondering what i think of you and i protect you out of courtesy.
too many times that i’ve held on when i needed to push away.
afraid to say what was on my mind afraid to say what i need to say.
too many things that you've said about me when i’m not around.
you think having the upper hand means you gotta keep putting me down.
but i’ve had too many standoffs with you it’s about as much as i can stand.
so i'm waiting until the upper hand is mine.
(one minute you're on top).
the next you're not watch it drop.
(making your heart stop).
just before you hit the floor.
(one minute you're on top).
next you're not missed your shot.
(making you're heart stop).
you think you've won.
(and then its all gone).
so many people like me put so much trust in all your lies.
so concerned with what you think to just say what we feel inside.
so many people like me walk on eggshells all day long.
all i know is that all i want is to feel like i’m not stepped on.
there are so many things you say that make me feel you've crossed the line.
what goes up will surely fall and i’m counting down the time.
cause i’ve had so many standoffs with you it’s about as much as i can stand.
so i'm waiting until the upper hand is mine.
(one minute you're on top).
the next you're not watch it drop.
(making your heart stop).
just before you hit the floor.
(one minute you're on top).
next you're not missed your shot.
(making you're heart stop).
you think you've won.
(and then its all gone).
(and then it’s all gone).
(and then its all gone).
(and then it’s all gone).
(now it’s all gone).
i know i’ll never trust a single thing you say.
you knew your lies would divide us but you lied anyway.
and all the lies have got you floating up above us all.
but what goes up has got to fall.
(one minute you're on top).
the next you're not watch it drop.
(making your heart stop).
just before you hit the floor.
(one minute you're on top).
next you're not missed your shot.
(making you're heart stop).
you think you've won.
(and then its all gone).
(and then it’s all gone).
(and then its all gone).
(and then it’s all gone).
(now it’s all gone).
easier to run.
it's easier to run
replacing this pain with something numb.
it's so much easier to go.
than face all this pain here all alone.
something has been taken from deep inside of me.
the secret i've kept locked away no one can ever see.
wounds so deep they never show they never go away.
like moving pictures in my head for years and years they've played.
(if i could change i would take back the pain i would).
(retrace every wrong move that i made i would).
(if i could stand up and take the blame i would).
(if i could take all the shame to the grave i would).
(if i could change i would take back the pain i would).
(retrace every wrong move that i made i would).
(if i could stand up and take the blame i would).
(i would take all my shame to the grave).
it's easier to run.
replacing this pain with something numb.
it's so much easier to go.
than face all this pain here all alone.
sometimes i remember the darkness of my past.
bringing back these memories i wish i didn't have.
sometimes i think of letting go and never looking back.
and never moving forward so there'd never be a past.
(if i could change i would take back the pain i would).
(retrace every wrong move that i made i would).
(if i could stand up and take the blame i would).
(if i could take all the shame to the grave i would).
(if i could change i would take back the pain i would).
(retrace every wrong move that i made i would).
(if i could stand up and take the blame i would).
(i would take all my shame to the grave).
just washing it aside.
all of the helplessness inside.
pretending i don't feel misplaced.
it's so much simpler than change.
it's easier to run.
replacing this pain with something numb.
it's so much easier to go.
than face all this pain here all alone.
it's easier to run.
