what's going on?
could this be my understanding.
it's not your fault i was being too demanding.
i must admit it's my pride that made me distant.
all because i hoped that you'd be someone different.
there's not much i know about you.
fear will always make you blind.
but the answer is in clear view.
it's amazing what you'll find face to face.
i turned away because i thought you were the problem.
tried to forget until i hit the bottom.
but when i faced you in my blank confusion.
i realized you weren't wrong, it was a mere illusion.
it really didn't make sense.
just to leave this unresolved.
it's not hard to go the distance.
when you finally get involved face to face.
