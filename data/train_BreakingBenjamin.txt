fast i fade away.
it's almost over.
hold on.
slow i suffocate.
i'm cold and broken.
alone.
it's hopeless, the end will come and wash it all away.
forsaken, i live for those i lost along the way.

leave the lost and dead behind.
now's your chance to run for cover.
i don't want to change the world.
i just wanna leave it colder.
light the fuse and burn it up.
take the path that leads to nowhere.
all is lost again.

crawl.
the shadow of a man.
i'm nothing less.
i am holding on, still holding on.
and every now and then life begins again.
i am holding on, still holding on.
i'm not like you.
your faceless lies.
your weak dead heart.
your black dead eyes.
i'll make it through, but not this time.
your hope is gone, and so is mine.
live, fight.
crawl back inside.
sick, blind.
love left behind.
and i won't live, your weak wicked lie.
you pull me in, i'm one step behind.
show me where it hurts.
and i'll make it worse.
are you holding on. keep holding on.
dilated eyes shine for one last time.
are you holding on. keep holding on.
you're not like me.
your faceless lies.
your weak dead heart.
your black dead eyes.
i'll break you in, and let this die.
your hope is gone.
and so is mine.
live, fight.
crawl back inside.
sick, blind.
love left behind.
and i won't live, your weak wicked lie.
you pull me in, i'm one step behind.
i'm becoming a monster, just like you.
after it all you'll try to break me too.
falling forever, chasing dreams.
i brought you to life so i can hear you scream.
live, fight.
crawl back inside.
sick, blind.
love left behind.
and i won't live, your weak wicked lie.
you pull me in, i'm one step behind.
i'm one step behind.
i'm one step behind.
give me a sign.
dead star shine.
light up the sky.
i'm all out of breath.
my walls are closing in.
days go by.
give me a sign.
come back to the end.
the shepherd of the damned.
i can feel you falling away.
no longer the lost.
no longer the same.
and i can see you starting to break.
i'll keep you alive.
if you show me the way.
forever, and ever.
the scars will remain.
i'm falling apart.

empty inside.
i'm already dead.
i'll rise to fall again.

hopeless.
here i lie forever.
sorrow still remains.
will the water pull me down and wash it all away.
come and take me over.
welcome to the game.
will the current drag me down and carry me away.
suddenly the light begins to fade.

anthem of the angels.
white walls surround us.

we can chase the dark together.
if you go then so will i.
there is nothing left of you.
i can see it in your eyes.

into the nothing.
screaming on the inside.
i am frail and withered.
cover up the wounds.
that i can't hide.
walls that lie between us.
the saint within the sinner.
i have lost the nerve.
but it's all right.
carry the wounded and shut your eyes.
all will be forgiven.
none will rise.
bury the fallen and lead the blind.
i will fight the loss.
dead inside.
into the nothing.
faded and weary.
i won't leave and let you fall behind.
live for the dying.
heaven hear me.
i know we can make it out alive.
leave me at the bottom.
i am lost forever.
letters from the dead.
say goodbye.
sorrow falls upon us.
this will be the last time.
days begin to end.
but i'll get by.
follow the hopeless.
and shut your eyes.
all will be abandoned.
none will shine.
gather the broken and leave this life.
lying in the earth.
side by side.
into the nothing.
faded and weary.
i won't leave and let you fall behind.
live for the dying.
heaven hear me.
i know we can make it out alive.
i'll keep you inside.
where i lead you cannot follow.
straight into the light.
as my breath grows still and shallow.
into the nothing.
faded and weary.
i won't leave and let you fall behind.
live for the dying.
heaven hear me.
i know we can make it out alive.
stay with me.
you're all i have left.
i know we can make it out alive.

without you.
search for the answers i knew all along.
i lost myself, we all fall down.
never the wiser of what i've become.
alone i stand, a broken man.
all i have is one last chance.
i won't turn my back on you.
take my hand, drag me down.
if you fall then i will too.
and i can't save what's left of you.
sing something new.
i have nothing left.
i can't face the dark without you.
there's nothing left to lose.
the fight never ends.
i can't face the dark without you.
swallow me under and pull me apart.
i understand, there's nothing left.
pain so familiar and close to the heart.
no more, no less, i won't forget.
come back down, save yourself.
i can't find my way to you.
and i can't bear to face the truth.
sing something new.
i have nothing left.
i can't face the dark without you.
there's nothing left to lose.
the fight never ends.
i can't face the dark without you.
i wanted to forgive.
i'm trying to forget.
don't leave me here again.
i am with you forever, the end.
sing something new.
i have nothing left.
i can't face the dark without you.
there's nothing left to lose.
the fight never ends.
i can't face the dark without you.
holding the hand that holds me down.

i don't care what you want.
i just want mine.
i don't care what you want.
i just want mine.
shut up.
smart little bitch.
i don't need lies.
i don't care what you want.
i just want mine.
get up.
force it to fit.
confined inside.
my dead eyes.
rain.
take a photograph,
it'll be the last,
not a dollar or a crowd could ever keep me here,
i don't have a past.
i just have a chance,
not a family or honest plea remains to say,
rain, rain go away,
come again another day,
all the world is waiting for the sun.
is it you i want or just the notion.
of a heart to wrap around so i can find my way around.
safe to say from here,
you're getting closer now,
we are never sad 'cause we are not allowed to be.
rain, rain go away,
come again another day,
all the world is waiting for the sun.
rain, rain go away,
come again another day,
all the world is waiting for the sun.
to lie here under you,
is all that i could ever do,
to lie here under you is all,
to lie here under you is all that i could ever do,
to lie here under you is all,
rain, rain go away,
come again another day,
all the world is waiting for the sun.
rain, rain go away,
come again another day,
all the world is waiting for the sun,
all the world is waiting for the sun,
all the world is waiting for the sun.
the diary of jane.
if i had to.
i would put myself right beside you.
so let me ask.
would you like that.
would you like that.
and i don't mind.
if you say this love is the last time.
so now i'll ask.
do you like that.
do you like that.
no.
something's getting in the way.
something's just about to break.
i will try to find my place in the diary of jane.
so tell me how it should be.
try to find out what makes you tick.
as i lie down.
sore and sick.
do you like that.
do you like that.
there's a fine line between love and hate.
and i don't mind.
just let me say that.
i like that.
i like that.
something's getting in the way.
something's just about to break.
i will try to find my place in the diary of jane.
as i burn another page,
as i look the other way.
i still try to find my place in the diary of jane.
so tell me how it should be.
desperate, i will crawl.
waiting for so long.
no love, there is no love.
die for anyone.
what have i become.
something's getting in the way.
something's just about to break.
i will try to find my place in the diary of jane.
as i burn another page,
as i look the other way.
i still try to find my place in the diary of jane.
breath.
i see nothing in your eyes, and the more i see the less i like.
is it over yet, in my head.
i know nothing of your kind, and i won't reveal your evil mind.
is it over yet. i can't win.
so sacrifice yourself, and let me have what's left.
i know that i can find the fire in your eyes.
i'm going all the way, get away, please.
you take the breath right out of me.
you left a hole where my heart should be.
you got to fight just to make it through,
'cause i will be the death of you.
this will be all over soon.
pour salt into the open wound.
is it over yet. let me in.
so sacrifice yourself, and let me have what's left.
i know that i can find the fire in your eyes.
i'm going all the way, get away, please.
you take the breath right out of me.
you left a hole where my heart should be.
you got to fight just to make it through,
'cause i will be the death of you.
i'm waiting, i'm praying, realize, start hating.
you take the breath right out of me.
you left a hole where my heart should be.
you got to fight just to make it through,
'cause i will be the death of you. 
you.
my hands are broken,
and time is going on and on, it goes forever (how long).
so i got high and lived all that life that i've taken all for granted.
promise me you'll try.
to leave it all behind,
'cause i've elected hell,
lying to myself.
why have i gone blind.
live another life.
you. you.
the only way out
is letting your guard down and never die forgotten (i know).
forgive me, my love,
i stand here all alone, and i can see the bottom.
promise me you'll try.
to leave it all behind,
'cause i've elected hell,
lying to myself.
why have i gone blind.
live another life.
you. you.
you. you.
you. you.
evil angel.
hold it together, birds of a feather,
nothing but lies and crooked wings.
i have the answer, spreading the cancer,
you are the faith inside me.
no, don't
leave me to die here,
help me survive here.
alone, don't remember, remember.

put me to sleep evil angel.
open your wings evil angel.
a-ah.
i'm a believer,
nothing could be worse,
all these imaginary friends.
hiding betrayal,
driving the nail,
hoping to find a savior.
no, don't
leave me to die here,
help me survive here.
alone, don't
surrender, surrender.
put me to sleep evil angel.
open your wings evil angel.
oh.
fly over me evil angel.
why can't i breathe evil angel.
put me to sleep evil angel.
open your wings evil angel.
oh.
fly over me evil angel.
why can't i breathe evil angel. 
until the end.
so clever,
whatever,
i'm done with these endeavors.
alone i walk the winding way.
(here i stay)
it's over,
no longer,
i feel it growing stronger.
i'll live to die another day,
until i fade away.
why give up, why give in.
it's not enough, it never is.
so i will go on until the end.
we've become desolate.
it's not enough, it never is.
but i will go on until the end.
surround me,
it's easy
to fall apart completely.
i feel you creeping up again.
in my head.
it's over,
no longer,
i feel it growing colder.
i knew this day would come to end,
so let this life begin.
why give up, why give in.
it's not enough, it never is.
so i will go on until the end.
we've become desolate.
it's not enough, it never is.
but i will go on until the end.
i've lost my way.
i've lost my way, but i will go on until the end.
living is hard enough
without you fucking up.
why give up, why give in.
it's not enough, it never is.
so i will go on until the end.
we've become desolate.
it's not enough, it never is.
but i will go on until the end.
i've lost my way.
i've lost my way, but i will go on until the end.
u-uh, u-uh.
the final fight i'll win,
the final fight i'll win,
the final fight i'll win,
but i will go on until the end. 
dance with the devil.
here i stand, helpless and left for dead.
close your eyes, so many days go by.
easy to find what's wrong, harder to find what's right.
i believe in you, i can show you that i can see right through all your empty lies.
i won't stay long, in this world so wrong.
say goodbye, as we dance with the devil tonight.
don't you dare look at him in the eye, as we dance with the devil tonight.
trembling, crawling across my skin.
feeling your cold dead eyes, stealing the life of mine.
i believe in you, i can show you that i can see right through all your empty lies.
i won't last long, in this world so wrong.
say goodbye, as we dance with the devil tonight.
don't you dare look at him in the eye, as we dance with the devil tonight.
hold on. hold on.
say goodbye, as we dance with the devil tonight.
don't you dare look at him in the eye, as we dance with the devil tonight.
hold on. hold on.
goodbye.
