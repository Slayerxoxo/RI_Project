it goes a one.
two, three
i was born with the hunger of a lion, the strength of a sun.
i don't need to sweat it when a competition come.
original style, like an 808 drum.
so i don't run the track, no, i make the track run.
my momma taught me words, my daddy built rockets.
i hold 'em both together now, tell me what i got.
it's a pretty smart weapon, i can shoot it, i can drop it.
but learn to respect it 'cause you clearly can't stop it.
like that
it ain't over.
'cause the shark's on the left side, the snake's on the right.
and anything you do, they wanna get a little bite.
it really doesn't matter if you're wrong or if you're right.
'cause once they get their teeth in nothing really fights.
and as for me i do it like i got nothing to lose.
and you can run your mouth like you could try to fill my shoes.
but steady little soldier, i ain't standing next to you.
i'll be laying on the ground before you're even in my view.
like that
give me the strength of the rising sun.
give me the truth of the words unsung.
and when the last bells ring, the poor men sing.
"bring me to kingdom come".
it's something for your people on the block to.
blackout and rock to, give you what you need.
like papa, who shot you.
separate the weak from the obsolete.
the meek, i creep hard on impostors.
and switch styles on the dime, quick-witted y'all.
quit tripping, i don't have time for your crying.
i grind tough, sucker, make your mind up.
are you in the firing squad or are you in the line-up?
bang, bang, little monkey man playing.
with the big guns only get you slayed.
i ain't playing, i'm just saying.
you ain't got a sliver of a chance.
i get iller, i deliver while you quiver in your pants.
so shake, shake down, money, here's the break down.
you can play the bank, imma play the bank take down.
and no mistakes now i'm coming to get you.
i'm just a banksy, you're a brainwash, get the picture?
it's like that
we swim against the rising waves.
and crash against the shore.
the body bends until it breaks.
the early morning sings no more.
so rest your head.
it's time to sleep.
and dream of what's in store.
the body bends until it breaks.
and sings again no more.
'cause time has torn the flesh away.
the early morning sings no more.
