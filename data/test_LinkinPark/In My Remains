separate
sifting through the wreckage.
i can't concentrate
searching for a message.
in the fear and pain
broken down and waiting.
for the chance to feel alive.
now in my remains.
are promises that never came.
set the silence free.
to wash away the worst of me.
come apart
falling in the cracks.
of every broken heart.
digging through the wreckage.
of your disregard
sinking down and waiting.
for the chance to feel alive.
now in my remains
are promises that never came.
set the silence free.
to wash away the worst of me.
like an army, falling.
one by one by one.
like an army, falling.
one by one by one.
like an army, falling.
one by one by one.
like an army, falling.
one by one by one.
now in my remains.
are promises that never came.
set the silence free.
to wash away the worst of me.
like an army, falling.
one by one by one.
like an army, falling.
one by one by one.
