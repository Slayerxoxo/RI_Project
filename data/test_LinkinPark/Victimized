no regret for the confidence betrayed.
no more hiding in shadow.
'cause i won't wait for the debt to be repaid.
time has come for you.
victimized, victimized, never again victimized.
victimized, victimized, never again victimized.
they're acting like they want a riot, it's a riot i'll give them.
as the sound climbs higher on this violent rhythm.
for you snakes in the grass, supplying the venom.
i ain't scared of your teeth, i admire what's in em.
keep 'em waiting in the shadows there, thinking they hidden.
but the truth is you don't have the stomach to get em.
go on already, hit em! yeah, you gotta be kiddin'
wanna talk about a victim, imma put you there with 'em!
victimized, victimized, never again victimized.
victimized, victimized, never again victimized.
