i am a little bit of loneliness a little bit of disregard.
handful of complaints but i canâ€™t help the fact that everyone can see these scars.
i am what i want you to want what i want you to feel.
but it's like no matter what i do, i can't convince you, to just believe this is real.
so i let go, watching you, turn your back like you always do.
face away and pretend that i'm not.
but i'll be here 'cause you're all that i got.
i can't feel the way i did before.
don't turn your back on me.
i won't be ignored.
time won't heal this damage anymore.
don't turn your back on me.
i won't be ignored.
i am a little bit insecure a little unconfident.
'cause you don't understand i do what i can but sometimes i don't make sense.
i am what you never wanna say but i've never had a doubt.
it's like no matter what i do i can't convince you for once just to hear me out.
so i let go watching you turn your back like you always do.
face away and pretend that i'm not.
but i'll be here 'cause you're all that i've got.
i can't feel the way i did before.
don't turn your back on me.
i won't be ignored.
time won't heal this damage anymore.
don't turn your back on me.
i won't be ignored.
hear me out now.
you're gonna listen to me, like it or not.
right now
hear me out now.
you're gonna listen to me, like it or not.
right now
i can't feel the way i did before.
don't turn your back on me.
i won't be ignored.
