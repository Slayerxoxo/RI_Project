the cycle repeated.
as explosions broke in the sky.
all that i needed.
was the one thing i couldn't find.
and you were there at the turn.
waiting to let me know.
we're building it up.
to break it back down.
we're building it up.
to burn it down.
we can't wait
to burn it to the ground.
the colors conflicted.
as the flames climbed into the clouds.
i wanted to fix this.
but couldn't stop from tearing it down.
and you were there at the turn.
caught in the burning glow.
and i was there at the turn.
waiting to let you know.
we're building it up.
to break it back down.
we're building it up.
to burn it down.
we can't wait
to burn it to the ground.
you told me, "yes".
you held me high.
and i believed when you told that lie.
i played soldier, you played king.
and struck me down, when i kissed that ring.
you lost that right, to hold that crown.
i built you up, but you let me down.
so when you fall, i'll take my turn.
and fan the flames.
as your blazes burn.
and you were there at the turn.
waiting to let me know.
we're building it up.
to break it back down.
we're building it up.
to burn it down.
we can't wait
to burn it to the ground.
when you fall, i'll take my turn.
and fan the flames.
as your blazes burn.
we can't wait
to burn it to the ground.
when you fall, i'll take my turn.
and fan the flames.
as your blazes burn.
we can't wait
to burn it to the ground.
