skin to bone, steel to rust.
ash to ashes dust to dust.
let tomorrow have its way.
with the promises we made.
skin to bone, steel to rust.
ash to ashes, dust to dust.
your deception, my disgust.
when your name is finally drawn,
i'll be happy that you're gone.
ash to ashes, dust to dust.
(aaah) ash to ashes, dust to dust.
(aaah) skin to bone and steel to rust.
right to left, left to right.
night to day and day to night.
as the starlight fades to gray,
i'll be marching far away.
right to left and left to right.
(aaah) ash to ashes, dust to dust.
(aaah) skin to bone and steel to rust.
let tomorrow have its way?
with the promises betrayed?
skin to bone and steel to rust.
skin to bone and steel to rust.
skin to bone and steel to rust.
