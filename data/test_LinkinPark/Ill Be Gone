like shining oil, this night is dripping down.
stars are slipping down, glistening.
and i'm trying not to think what i'm leaving now.
no deceiving now, it's time you let me know.
let me know.
when the lights go out and we open our eyes,
out there in the silence, i'll be gone, i'll be gone.
let the sun fade out and another one rise
climbing through tomorrow, i'll be gone, i'll be gone.
this air between us is getting thinner now.
into winter now. bitter sweet.
and 'cross that horizon this sun is setting down.
you're forgetting now, it's time you let me go, let me go.
when the lights go out and we open our eyes,
out there in the silence, i'll be gone, i'll be gone.
let the sun fade out and another one rise.
climbing through tomorrow, i'll be gone, i'll be gone.
and tell them i couldn't tell myself.
and tell them i was alone.
oh, tell me i am the only one.
and there's nothing that can stop me.
when the lights go out and we open our eyes,
out there in the silence, i'll be gone, i'll be gone.
let the sun fade out and another one rise.
climbing through tomorrow, i'll be gone, i'll be gone, i'll be gone.
