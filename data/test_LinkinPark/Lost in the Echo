you were that foundation.
never gonna be another one, no.
i followed, so taken.
so conditioned i could never let go.
then sorrow, then sickness.
then the shock when you flip it on me.
so hollow, so vicious.
so afraid i couldn't let myself see.
that i could never be held.
back or up no, i'll hold myself.
check the rep, yep you know mine well.
forget the rest let them know my hell.
there and back yet my soul ain't sell.
kept respect up,the best they fell,
let the rest be the tale they tell.
that i was there saying.
in these promises broken.
deep below
each word gets lost in the echo.
so one last lie i can see through.
this time i finally let you.
go, go, go.
test my will, test my heart.
let me tell you how the odds gonna stack up.
y'all go hard, i go smart.
how's that working out for y'all in the back, huh?
i've seen that frustration.
been crossed and lost and told "no".
and i've come back unshaken.
let down and lived and let go.
so you can let it be known.
i don't hold back, i hold my own.
i can't be mapped, i can't be cloned.
i can't c-flat, it ain't my tone.
i can't fall back, i came too far.
hold myself up and love my scars.
let the bells ring wherever they are.
'cause i was there saying.
in these promises broken.
deep below
each word gets lost in the echo.
so one last lie i can see through.
this time i finally let you go!!!
go, go, go.
no, you can tell 'em all now.
i don't back up, i don't back down.
i don't fold up, and i don't bow.
i don't roll over, don't know how.
i don't care where the enemies are.
can't be stopped, all i know; go hard.
won't forget how i got this far.
for every time saying.
in these promises broken.
deep below
each word gets lost in the echo.
so one last lie i can see through.
this time i finally let you.
go, go, go. (go, go, go).
go. go, go. (go, go, go).
