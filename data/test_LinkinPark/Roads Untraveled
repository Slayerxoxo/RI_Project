weep not for roads untraveled.
weep not for paths left alone.
'cause beyond every bend.
is a long blinding end.
it's the worst kind of pain.
i've known
give up your heart left broken.
and let that mistake pass on.
'cause the love that you lost.
wasn't worth what it cost.
and in time you'll be glad it's gone.
weep not for roads untraveled.
weep not for sights unseen.
may your love never end.
and if you need a friend.
there's a seat here alongside me.
