nothing ever stops all these thoughts and the pain attached to them.
sometimes i wonder why this is happening.
it's like nothing i can do would distract me when.
i think of how i shot myself in the back again.
'cause from the infinite words i could say i.
put all pain you gave to me on display.
but didn't realize instead of setting it free i.
took what i hated and made it a part of me.
(never goes away)
(never goes away).
(and now).
(you've become a part of me).
(you'll always be right here).
(you've become a part of me).
(you'll always be my fear).
(i can't separate).
(myself from what i've done).
(giving up a part of me).
(i've let myself become you).
hearing your name the memories come back again.
i remember when it started happening.
i see you in every thought i had and then.
the thoughts slowly found words attached to them.
and i knew as they escaped away.
i was committing myself to them and everyday.
i regret saying those things cuz now i see that i.
took what i hated and made it a part of me.
(never goes away)
(never goes away).
(and now).
(you've become a part of me).
(you'll always be right here).
(you've become a part of me).
(you'll always be my fear).
(i can't separate).
(myself from what i've done).
(giving up a part of me).
(i've let myself become you).
(never goes away)
(never goes away).
(never goes away)
(never goes away).
(get away from me).
give me my space back you gotta just.
(go)
everything comes down the memories of.
(you)
i've kept it in but now i'm letting you.
(know)
i let you go so get away from.
(me)
give me my space back you gotta just.
(go)
everything comes down the memories of.
(you)
i've kept it but now i'm letting you.
(know)
i let you go.
(and now).
(you've become a part of me).
(you'll always be right here).
(you've become a part of me).
(you'll always be my fear).
(i can't separate).
(myself from what i've done).
(giving up a part of me).
(i've let myself become you).
i've let myself become you.
i've let myself become lost inside these thoughts of you.
giving up a part of me, i've let myself become you.
