Fade Away.
I'm cold and broken.
It's over I didn't want to see it come to this.
I wonder if I will ever see your face again.
And I know that I will find a way to shed my skin.
It's simple I know that I will suffer in the end.
Fast I fade away.
It's almost over.
Hold on.
Slow I suffocate.
I'm cold and broken.
Alone.
It's hopeless, the end will come and wash it all away.
Forsaken, I live for those I lost along the way.
And I can't remember how it all began to break.
You suffer, I live to fight and die another day.
Fast I fade away.
It's almost over.
Hold on.
Slow I suffocate.
I'm cold and broken.
Alone.
Fast I fade away.
It's almost over.
Hold on.
Slow I suffocate.
I'm cold and broken.
Alone.
I'm cold and broken.
I Will Not Bow.
Fall.
Now the dark begins to rise.
Save your breath, it's far from over.
Leave the lost and dead behind.
Now's your chance to run for cover.
I don't want to change the world.
I just wanna leave it colder.
Light the fuse and burn it up.
Take the path that leads to nowhere.
All is lost again.
But I'm not giving in.
I will not bow.
I will not break.
I will shut the world away.
I will not fall.
I will not fade.
I will take your breath away.
Fall.
Watch the end through dying eyes.
Now the dark is taking over.
Show me where forever dies.
Take the fall and run to Heaven.
All is lost again.
But I'm not giving in.
I will not bow.
I will not break.
I will shut the world away.
I will not fall.
I will not fade.
I will take your breath away.
And I'll survive, paranoid.
I have lost the will to change.
And I am not proud, cold-blooded fake.
I will shut the world away.
Open your eyes.
I will not bow.
I will not break.
I will shut the world away.
I will not fall.
I will not fade.
I will take your breath away.
And I'll survive; paranoid.
I have lost the will to change.
And I am not proud, cold-blooded fake.
I will shut the world away.
Fall.



So Cold.
Crowded streets are cleared away.
One by One.
Hollow heroes separate.
As they run.
You're so cold.
Keep your hand in mine.
Wise men wonder while.
Strong men die.
Show me how it ends it's alright.
Show me how defenseless you really are.
satisfied and empty inside.
Well, that's alright, let's give this another try.
If you find your family, don't you cry.
In this land of make-believe, dead and dry.
You're so cold, but you feel alive.
Lay your hand on me one last time.
Show me how it ends it's alright.
Show me how defenseless you really are.
satisfied and empty inside.
Well, that's alright, let's give this another try.
Show me how it ends it's alright.
Show me how defenseless you really are.
satisfied and empty inside.
Well, that's alright, let's give this another try.
It's alright
It's alright
It's alright
It's alright
It's alright
It's alright
It's alright
It's alright
It's alright
Simple Design.
I live a chemical life.
I'm on a mission to try.
You went insane for a day.
I'll have to shove it away.
My only option is gone.
Smile as they break and they fall.
You want a simpler life.
You can't erase what was mine.
You must be out of your mind.
This was a simple design.
You fuck it up everytime.
How could you leave me behind.
It's alright, it's alright.
'cause I know what you want.
but you'll just have to wait.
If I had it to give.
I would give it away.
I'm living it up.
while I'm falling from grace.
There's no way, there's no way that I'm running away.
I'm used to making it worse.
Made up of four letter words.
You wanna know what it was.
Now isolated and gone.
You fall apart at the seams.
I'll never know what it means.
Try not to pull it apart.
You're aiming straight from the heart.
You must be out of your mind.
This was a simple design.
You fuck it up everytime.
How could you leave me behind.
It's alright, it's alright.
'cause I know what you want.
but you'll just have to wait.
If I had it to give.
I would give it away.
I'm living it up.
while I'm falling from grace.
There's no way, there's no way that I'm running away.
It had to be the worst for me.
I don't know what to say so let me be.
And now I find you left me behind.
I don't know what to say so nevermind.
You're mine.
It's alright, it's alright.
'cause I know what you want.
but you'll just have to wait.
If I had it to give.
I would give it away.
I'm living it up.
while I'm falling from grace.
There's no way, there's no way that I'm running away.
Follow Me.
I'm losing sight.
Don't count on me.
I chase the sun.
It chases me.
You know my name.
You know my face.
You'd know my heart.
If you knew my place.
I walked straight down.
As far as I can go.
I follow you.
You follow me.
I don't know why.
You lie so clean.
I'll break right through the irony.
Enlighten me.
Reveal my fate.
Just cut these strings.
That hold me safe.
You know my head.
You know my gaze.
You'd know my heart.
If you knew your place.
I walked straight down.
As far as I can go.
I follow you.
You follow me.
I don't know why.
You lie so clean.
I'll break right through the irony.
Cure this wait.
I, I hate this wait.
I hate this wait.
I follow you.
You follow me.
I don't know why.
You lie so clean.
I'll break right through the irony.
I don't know why.
I don't know why.
I follow you.
You follow me.
I don't know why.
You lie so clean.
I'll break right through the irony.
