Fade Away.
I'm cold and broken.
It's over I didn't want to see it come to this.
I wonder if I will ever see your face again.
And I know that I will find a way to shed my skin.
It's simple I know that I will suffer in the end.
Fast I fade away.
It's almost over.
Hold on.
Slow I suffocate.
I'm cold and broken.
Alone.
It's hopeless, the end will come and wash it all away.
Forsaken, I live for those I lost along the way.
And I can't remember how it all began to break.
You suffer, I live to fight and die another day.
Fast I fade away.
It's almost over.
Hold on.
Slow I suffocate.
I'm cold and broken.
Alone.
Fast I fade away.
It's almost over.
Hold on.
Slow I suffocate.
I'm cold and broken.
Alone.
I'm cold and broken.
I Will Not Bow.
Fall.
Now the dark begins to rise.
Save your breath, it's far from over.
Leave the lost and dead behind.
Now's your chance to run for cover.
I don't want to change the world.
I just wanna leave it colder.
Light the fuse and burn it up.
Take the path that leads to nowhere.
All is lost again.
But I'm not giving in.
I will not bow.
I will not break.
I will shut the world away.
I will not fall.
I will not fade.
I will take your breath away.
Fall.
Watch the end through dying eyes.
Now the dark is taking over.
Show me where forever dies.
Take the fall and run to Heaven.
All is lost again.
But I'm not giving in.
I will not bow.
I will not break.
I will shut the world away.
I will not fall.
I will not fade.
I will take your breath away.
And I'll survive, paranoid.
I have lost the will to change.
And I am not proud, cold-blooded fake.
I will shut the world away.
Open your eyes.
I will not bow.
I will not break.
I will shut the world away.
I will not fall.
I will not fade.
I will take your breath away.
And I'll survive; paranoid.
I have lost the will to change.
And I am not proud, cold-blooded fake.
I will shut the world away.
Fall.
Crawl.
The shadow of a man.
I'm nothing less.
I am holding on, still holding on.
And every now and then life begins again.
I am holding on, still holding on.
I'm not like you.
Your faceless lies.
Your weak dead heart.
Your black dead eyes.
I'll make it through, but not this time.
Your hope is gone, and so is mine.
Live, fight.
Crawl back inside.
Sick, blind.
Love left behind.
And I won't live, your weak wicked lie.
You pull me in, I'm one step behind.
Show me where it hurts.
And I'll make it worse.
Are you holding on. Keep holding on.
Dilated eyes shine for one last time.
Are you holding on. Keep holding on.
You're not like me.
Your faceless lies.
Your weak dead heart.
Your black dead eyes.
I'll break you in, and let this die.
Your hope is gone.
And so is mine.
Live, fight.
Crawl back inside.
Sick, blind.
Love left behind.
And I won't live, your weak wicked lie.
You pull me in, I'm one step behind.
I'm becoming a monster, just like you.
After it all you'll try to break me too.
Falling forever, chasing dreams.
I brought you to life so I can hear you scream.
Live, fight.
Crawl back inside.
Sick, blind.
Love left behind.
And I won't live, your weak wicked lie.
You pull me in, I'm one step behind.
I'm one step behind.
I'm one step behind.
Give Me A Sign.
Dead star shine.
Light up the sky.
I'm all out of breath.
My walls are closing in.
Days go by.
Give me a sign.
Come back to the end.
The shepherd of the damned.
I can feel you falling away.
No longer the lost.
No longer the same.
And I can see you starting to break.
I'll keep you alive.
If you show me the way.
Forever, and ever.
the scars will remain.
I'm falling apart.
Leave me here forever in the dark.
Daylight dies.
Blackout the sky.
Does anyone care.
Is anybody there.
Take this life.
Empty inside.
I'm already dead.
I'll rise to fall again.
I can feel you falling away.
No longer the lost.
No longer the same.
And I can see you starting to break.
I'll keep you alive.
If you show me the way.
Forever, and ever.
the scars will remain.
I'm falling apart.
Leave me here forever in the dark.
God help me I've come undone.
Out of the light of the sun.
God help me I've come undone.
Out of the light of the sun.
I can feel you falling away.
No longer the lost.
No longer the same.
And I can see you starting to break.
I'll keep you alive.
If you show me the way.
Forever, and ever.
the scars will remain.
Give me a sign.
There's something buried in the words.
Give me a sign.
Your tears are adding to the flood.
Just give me a sign.
there's something buried in the words.
Give me a sign.
Your tears are adding to the flood.
Just give me a sign.
There's something buried in the words.
Give me a sign.
Your tears are adding to the flood.
Forever, and ever.
The scars will remain.
Hopeless.
Here I lie forever.
Sorrow still remains.
Will the water pull me down and wash it all away.
Come and take me over.
Welcome to the game.
Will the current drag me down and carry me away.
Suddenly the light begins to fade.
HOPELESS.
I'm falling down.
FILTHY.
I can't wake up.
I can not hold on.
I will not let go.
WORTHLESS.
It's over now.
GUILTY.
There's no way out.
I can not hold on.
I will not let go.
Silent I go under.
I am not afraid.
I can see the daylight shine.
And slowly drift away.
Safe to say it's over.
Sink into the grave.
There is nothing left inside.
But I am wide awake.
I can hear the devil call my name.
HOPELESS.
I'm falling down.
FILTHY.
I can't wake up.
I can not hold on.
I will not let go.
WORTHLESS.
It's over now.
GUILTY.
There's no way out.
I can not hold on.
I will not let go .
What Lies Beneath.
Take a breath.
Hold it in.
Start a fight.
You won't win.
Had enough.
Let's begin.
Nevermind.
I don't care.
All in all.
You're no good.
You don't cry.
Like you should.
Let it go.
If you could.
When love dies in the end.
So I'll find what lies beneath.
Your sick twisted smile.
As I lie underneath.
Your cold jaded eyes.
Now you turn the tide on me.
'Cause you're so unkind.
I will always be here.
For the rest of my life.
Here we go.
Does it hurt.
Say goodbye.
to this world.
I will not.
Be undone.
Come to life.
It gets worse.
All in all.
You're no good.
You don't cry.
Like you should.
I'll be gone.
when you fall.
Your sad life.
Says it all.
So I'll find what lies beneath.
Your sick twisted smile.
As I lie underneath.
Your cold jaded eyes.
Now you turn the tide on me.
'Cause you're so unkind.
I will always be here.
For the rest of my life.
Don't carry me under.
You're the devil in disguise.
God sing for the hopeless.
I'm the one you left behind.
So I'll find what lies beneath.
Your sick twisted smile.
As I lie underneath.
Your cold jaded eyes.
Now you turn the tide on me.
'Cause you're so unkind.
I will always be here.
For the rest of my life.
Anthem Of The Angels.
White walls surround us.
No light will touch your face again.
Rain taps the window.
As we sleep among the dead.
Days go on forever.
But I have not left your side.
We can chase the dark together.
If you go then so will I.
There is nothing left of you.
I can see it in your eyes.
Sing the anthem of the angels.
And say the last goodbye.
Cold light above us.
Hope fills the heart.
And fades away.
Skin white as winter.
As the sky returns to grey.
Days go on forever.
But I have not left your side.
We can chase the dark together.
If you go then so will I.
There is nothing left of you.
I can see it in your eyes.
Sing the anthem of the angels.
And say the last goodbye.
I keep holding onto you.
But I can't bring you back to life.
Sing the anthem of the angels.
Then say the last goodbye.
You're dead alive.
You're dead alive.
You're dead alive.
You're dead alive.
There is nothing left of you.
I can see it in your eyes.
Sing the anthem of the angels.
And say the last goodbye.
I keep holding onto you.
But I can't bring you back to life.
Sing the anthem of the angels.
And say the last goodbye.
Sing the anthem of the angels.
And say the last goodbye.
Sing the anthem of the angels.
Lights Out.
I am done pretending.
You have failed to find what's left.
I will suck you dry again.
Some are not worth saving.
You are such a pretty mess.
I will choke the life within.
Now you want to take me down.
As if I even care.
I am the monster in your head.
And I thought you'd learn by now.
It seems you haven't yet.
I am the venom in your skin.
And now your life.
Is broken.
After the lights go out on you.
After your worthless life is through.
I will remember how you scream.
I can't afford to care.
I can't afford to care.
I am suffocating.
You have failed to pull me in.
I will drag you down again.
Life is unrelenting.
Feeding lies into my head.
I will feed the lies you live.
Now you want to take me down.
As if I even care.
I am the monster in your head.
And I thought you'd learn by now.
It seems you haven't yet.
I am the venom in your skin.
And now your life.
Is broken.
After the lights go out on you.
After your worthless life is through.
I will remember how you scream.
I can't afford to care.
I can't afford to care.
I can't afford to care.
After the lights go out on you.
After your worthless life is through.
I will remember how you scream.
I can't afford to care.
I can't afford to care.
I can't afford to care .
Dear Agony.
I have nothing left to give.
I have found the perfect end.
You were made to make it hurt.
Disappear into the dirt.
Carry me to heaven's arms.
Light the way and let me go.
Take the time to take my breath.
I will end where I began.
And I will find the enemy within.
Cause I can feel it crawl beneath my skin.
Dear Agony.
Just let go of me.
Suffer slowly.
Is this the way it's gotta be..
Dear Agony.
Suddenly.
The lights go out.
Let forever.
Drag me down.
I will fight for one last breath.
I will fight until the end.
And I will find the enemy within.
Cause I can feel it crawl beneath my skin.
Dear Agony.
Just let go of me.
Suffer slowly.
Is this the way it's gotta be.
Don't bury me.
Faceless enemy.
I'm so sorry.
Is this the way it's gotta be.
Dear Agony.
Leave me alone.
God let me go.
I'm blue and cold.
Black sky will burn.
Love pull me down.
Hate lift me up.
Just turn around.
There's nothing left.
Somewhere far beyond this world.
I feel nothing anymore.
Dear Agony.
Just let go of me.
Suffer slowly.
Is this the way it's gotta be.
Don't bury me.
Faceless enemy.
I'm so sorry.
Is this the way it's gotta be.
Dear Agony.
I feel nothing anymore.
Into The Nothing.
Screaming on the inside.
I am frail and withered.
Cover up the wounds.
That I can't hide.
Walls that lie between us.
The saint within the sinner.
I have lost the nerve.
But it's all right.
Carry the wounded and shut your eyes.
All will be forgiven.
None will rise.
Bury the fallen and lead the blind.
I will fight the loss.
Dead inside.
Into the nothing.
Faded and weary.
I won't leave and let you fall behind.
Live for the dying.
Heaven hear me.
I know we can make it out alive.
Leave me at the bottom.
I am lost forever.
Letters from the dead.
Say goodbye.
Sorrow falls upon us.
This will be the last time.
Days begin to end.
But I'll get by.
Follow the hopeless.
And shut your eyes.
All will be abandoned.
None will shine.
Gather the broken and leave this life.
Lying in the earth.
Side by side.
Into the nothing.
Faded and weary.
I won't leave and let you fall behind.
Live for the dying.
Heaven hear me.
I know we can make it out alive.
I'll keep you inside.
Where I lead you cannot follow.
Straight into the light.
As my breath grows still and shallow.
Into the nothing.
Faded and weary.
I won't leave and let you fall behind.
Live for the dying.
Heaven hear me.
I know we can make it out alive.
Stay with me.
You're all I have left.
I know we can make it out alive.
Stay with me.
You're all I have left.
I know we can make it out alive.
Without You.
Search for the answers I knew all along.
I lost myself, we all fall down.
Never the wiser of what I've become.
Alone I stand, a broken man.
All I have is one last chance.
I won't turn my back on you.
Take my hand, drag me down.
If you fall then I will too.
And I can't save what's left of you.
Sing something new.
I have nothing left.
I can't face the dark without you.
There's nothing left to lose.
The fight never ends.
I can't face the dark without you.
Swallow me under and pull me apart.
I understand, there's nothing left.
Pain so familiar and close to the heart.
No more, no less, I won't forget.
Come back down, save yourself.
I can't find my way to you.
And I can't bear to face the truth.
Sing something new.
I have nothing left.
I can't face the dark without you.
There's nothing left to lose.
The fight never ends.
I can't face the dark without you.
I wanted to forgive.
I'm trying to forget.
Don't leave me here again.
I am with you forever, the end.
Sing something new.
I have nothing left.
I can't face the dark without you.
There's nothing left to lose.
The fight never ends.
I can't face the dark without you.
Holding the hand that holds me down.
I forgive you, forget you, the end.
Holding the hand that holds me down.
I forgive you, forget you, the end .
So Cold.
Crowded streets are cleared away.
One by One.
Hollow heroes separate.
As they run.
You're so cold.
Keep your hand in mine.
Wise men wonder while.
Strong men die.
Show me how it ends it's alright.
Show me how defenseless you really are.
satisfied and empty inside.
Well, that's alright, let's give this another try.
If you find your family, don't you cry.
In this land of make-believe, dead and dry.
You're so cold, but you feel alive.
Lay your hand on me one last time.
Show me how it ends it's alright.
Show me how defenseless you really are.
satisfied and empty inside.
Well, that's alright, let's give this another try.
Show me how it ends it's alright.
Show me how defenseless you really are.

It's alright
It's alright
It's alright

Simple Design.
I live a chemical life.
I'm on a mission to try.
You went insane for a day.
I'll have to shove it away.
My only option is gone.
Smile as they break and they fall.
You want a simpler life.
You can't erase what was mine.
You must be out of your mind.
This was a simple design.
You fuck it up everytime.
How could you leave me behind.
It's alright, it's alright.
'cause I know what you want.
but you'll just have to wait.
If I had it to give.
I would give it away.
I'm living it up.
while I'm falling from grace.
There's no way, there's no way that I'm running away.
I'm used to making it worse.
Made up of four letter words.
You wanna know what it was.
Now isolated and gone.
You fall apart at the seams.
I'll never know what it means.
Try not to pull it apart.
You're aiming straight from the heart.
You must be out of your mind.
This was a simple design.
You fuck it up everytime.
How could you leave me behind.
It's alright, it's alright.
'cause I know what you want.
but you'll just have to wait.
If I had it to give.
I would give it away.
I'm living it up.
while I'm falling from grace.
There's no way, there's no way that I'm running away.
It had to be the worst for me.
I don't know what to say so let me be.
And now I find you left me behind.
I don't know what to say so nevermind.
You're mine.
It's alright, it's alright.
'cause I know what you want.

If I had it to give.
I would give it away.
I'm living it up.
while I'm falling from grace.
There's no way, there's no way that I'm running away.
Follow Me.
I'm losing sight.
Don't count on me.
I chase the sun.
It chases me.
You know my name.
You know my face.
You'd know my heart.
If you knew my place.
I walked straight down.
As far as I can go.
I follow you.
You follow me.
I don't know why.
You lie so clean.
I'll break right through the irony.
Enlighten me.
Reveal my fate.
Just cut these strings.
That hold me safe.
You know my head.
You know my gaze.
You'd know my heart.
If you knew your place.
I walked straight down.
As far as I can go.
I follow you.
You follow me.
I don't know why.
You lie so clean.

Cure this wait.

You lie so clean.
I'll break right through the irony.
Firefly.
You my friend.
You're a lot like them.
But I caught your lie.
And you know I did.
Now I'm lost in you.
Like I always do.
And I'd die to win.
'Cause I'm born to lose.
Firefly.
Could you shine your light.
Now I know your ways.
'cause they're just like mine.
Now I'm justified.
As I fall in line.
And it's hard to try.
When you're open wide.
Take my hand.
We'll be off and then.
We'll come back again.
To a different land.
Now I like this way.
You can go away.
If you guess the name.
You cannot replace.
Firefly.
Could you shine your light.
Now I know your ways.
'cause they're just like mine.
Now I'm justified.
As I fall in line.
And it's hard to try.
When you're open wide.
Bring me your enemies.
Lay them before me.
And walk away.
Firefly.
Could you shine your light.
Now I know your ways.
'cause they're just like mine.
Now I'm justified.
As I fall in line.
And it's hard to try.
When you're open wide.
Fuck you firefly.
Have you lost your light.
Now I hate your ways.
'cause they're just like mine.
So you lost my friend.
Such a sorry end.
And I don't know why.
So I choke and smile .
Break My Fall.
You fought me once but not again.
You let me feel your heavy hand.
I will clean your fucking mess.
And leave no trace of evidence.
I am losing you again.
Let me out and let me in.
'cause you're not alone here.
Not at all.
Let me belong here.
Break my fall.
Shelter me from this again.
Dedicated to the end.
Help me break my conscience in.
To free us from our innocence.
I am losing you again.
Let me out and let me in.
'cause you're not alone here.
Not at all.
Let me belong here.
Break my fall.
Mayday, Mayday.
Requesting permission to land.
I cannot control the plane.
We are in danger of crashing.
I am losing you again.
Let me out and let me in.
'cause you're not alone here.
Not at all.
Let me belong here.
Break my fall.
Break my fall.
Break my fall.
Break my fall.
Break my fall.
Break my fall.
Forget It.
It's a crime you let it happen to me.
Nevermind, I'll let it happen to you.
Out of mind, forget it there's nothing to lose.
But my mind and all the things I wanted.
Everytime I get it I throw it away.
It's a sign, I get it, I wanna stay.
By the time I lose it I'm not afraid.
I'm alive but I can Surely fake it.
How can I believe when this cloud hangs over me.
You're the part of me that I don't wanna see.
Forget it.
There's a place I see you follow me.
Just a taste of all that might come to be.
I'm alone but holding breath you can breathe.
To question every answer counted.
Just fade away.
Please let me stay.
Caught in your way.
Forget it.
Just fade away.
Please let me stay.
Caught in your way.
It's a crime you let it happen to me.
Out of mind, I love it, easy to please.
Nevermind, forget it, just memories.
On a page inside a spiral notebook.
Just fade away.
Please let me stay.
Caught in your way.
I can live forever here.
Forget it.
How can I believe when this cloud hangs over me.
You're a part of me that I don't wanna see.
I can live forever here.
Sooner Or Later.
I want a normal life.
just like a new born child.
I am a lover hater.
I am an instigator.
You are an oversight.
Don't try to compromise.
I'll learn to love to hate it.
I am not integrated.
Just call my name.
You'll be okay.
Your scream is burning through my veins.
Sooner or later you're gonna hate it.
Go ahead and throw your life away.
Driving me under, leaving me out there.
Go ahead and throw your life away.
You're like an infantile.
I knew it all the while.
You sit and try to play me.
Just like you see on tv.
I am an oversight.
Just like a parasite.
Why am I so pathetic.
I know you won't forget it.
Just call my name.
You'll be okay.
Your scream is burning through my veins.
Sooner or later you're gonna hate it.
Go ahead and throw my life away.
Driving me under, leaving me out there.
Go ahead and throw my life away.
Sooner or later you're gonna hate it.
Go ahead and throw our life away.
Driving me under, leaving me out there.
Go ahead and throw our life away.
Throw our life away.
Ooooo.
Throw our life away.
Breakdown.
Breakdown.
Let the fun and games begin.
She is spayed and broken in.
Skin is cold and white.
Such a lovely lonely night.
Heaven is on the way.
You could feel the hate.
but I guess you never will.
I'm on a roll again.
and I want an end.
'cause I feel you creeping in.
What I found in this town.
I'm heading for a breakdown.
What's that sound, you're so loud.
I'm heading for a breakdown.
Drank up all my alcohol.
This is not a free for all.
I'll be there for you.
'Til my heart is black and blue.
Heaven is on the way.
You could feel the hate.
but I guess you never will.
I'm on a roll again.
and I want an end.
'cause I feel you creeping in.
What I found in this town.
I'm heading for a breakdown.
What's that sound, you're so loud.
I'm heading for a breakdown.
What I found in this town.
I'm heading for a breakdown.
What's that sound, you're so loud.
I'm heading for a breakdown.
You breakdown, you're so proud.
I'm heading for a breakdown.
What's that sound, it's so loud.
I'm heading for a breakdown.
No.
Away.
Cold am I.
I'm beside myself.
Because there's no one else.
Have I grown.
So blind.
Only god could save you.
If you knew your way to the light.
So fly away.
And leave it behind.
Just stay awake.
There's nowhere to hide.
I see you.
Cause you won't get out of my way.
I hear you.
Cause you won't quit screaming my name.
I feel you.
Cause you won't stop touching my skin.
I need you.
They're coming to take you away.
Frail and dry.
I could lose it all.
But I cannot recall.
It's all wrong.
Don't cry.
Clear away this hate.
And we can start to make it alright.
So fly away.
And leave it behind.
Return someday.
With red in your eyes.
I see you.
Cause you won't get out of my way.
I hear you.
Cause you won't quit screaming my name.
I feel you.
Cause you won't stop touching my skin.
I need you.
They're coming to take you away.
I see you.
Cause you won't get out of my way.
I hear you.
Cause you won't quit screaming my name.
I feel you.
Cause you won't stop touching my skin.
I need you.
They're coming to take you away.
Believe.
Don't tread the water.
Just stay still.
I'll not be bothered.
By you until.
I'm picking sides.
And pulling the strings.
I'm living lies.
And shedding the skin.
I'm open wide.
And letting you in.
I'm wronging rights.
Believe.
I don't care what you want.
I just want mine.
Shut up.
Smart little bitch.
I don't need lies.
I don't care what you want.
I just want mine.
Get up.
Force it to fit.
Confined inside.
Don't pull me under.
Into the deep.
I often wonder.
How it should be.
I'm picking sides.
And pulling the strings.
I'm living lies.
And shedding the skin.
I'm open wide.
And letting you in.
I'm wronging rights.
Believe.
I don't care what you want.
I just want mine.
Shut up.
Smart little bitch.
I don't need lies.
I don't care what you want.
I just want mine.
Get up.
Force it to fit.
Confined inside.
I don't care what you want.
I just want mine.
I don't care what you want.
I just want mine.
Shut up.
Smart little bitch.
I don't need lies.
I don't care what you want.
I just want mine.
Get up.
Force it to fit.
Confined inside.
My dead eyes.
Rain.
Take a photograph,
It'll be the last,
Not a dollar or a crowd could ever keep me here,
I don't have a past.
I just have a chance,
Not a family or honest plea remains to say,
Rain, rain go away,
Come again another day,
All the world is waiting for the sun.
Is it you I want or just the notion.
Of a heart to wrap around so I can find my way around.
Safe to say from here,
You're getting closer now,
We are never sad 'cause we are not allowed to be.
Rain, rain go away,
Come again another day,
All the world is waiting for the sun.
Rain, rain go away,
Come again another day,
All the world is waiting for the sun.
To lie here under you,
Is all that I could ever do,
To lie here under you is all,
To lie here under you is all that i could ever do,
To lie here under you is all,
Rain, rain go away,
Come again another day,
All the world is waiting for the sun.
Rain, rain go away,
Come again another day,
All the world is waiting for the sun,
All the world is waiting for the sun,
All the world is waiting for the sun.
The Diary Of Jane.
If I had to.
I would put myself right beside you.
So let me ask.
Would you like that.
Would you like that.
And I don't mind.
If you say this love is the last time.
So now I'll ask.
Do you like that.
Do you like that.
No.
Something's getting in the way.
Something's just about to break.
I will try to find my place in the diary of Jane.
So tell me how it should be.
Try to find out what makes you tick.
As I lie down.
Sore and sick.
Do you like that.
Do you like that.
There's a fine line between love and hate.
And I don't mind.
Just let me say that.
I like that.
I like that.
Something's getting in the way.
Something's just about to break.
I will try to find my place in the diary of Jane.
As I burn another page,
As I look the other way.
I still try to find my place in the diary of Jane.
So tell me how it should be.
Desperate, I will crawl.
Waiting for so long.
No love, there is no love.
Die for anyone.
What have I become.
Something's getting in the way.
Something's just about to break.
I will try to find my place in the diary of Jane.
As I burn another page,
As I look the other way.
I still try to find my place in the diary of Jane.
Breath.
I see nothing in your eyes, and the more I see the less I like.
Is it over yet, in my head.
I know nothing of your kind, and I won't reveal your evil mind.
Is it over yet. I can't win.
So sacrifice yourself, and let me have what's left.
I know that I can find the fire in your eyes.
I'm going all the way, get away, please.
You take the breath right out of me.
You left a hole where my heart should be.
You got to fight just to make it through,
'cause I will be the death of you.
This will be all over soon.
Pour salt into the open wound.
Is it over yet. Let me in.
So sacrifice yourself, and let me have what's left.
I know that I can find the fire in your eyes.
I'm going all the way, get away, please.
You take the breath right out of me.
You left a hole where my heart should be.
You got to fight just to make it through,
'cause I will be the death of you.
I'm waiting, I'm praying, realize, start hating.
You take the breath right out of me.
You left a hole where my heart should be.
You got to fight just to make it through,
'cause I will be the death of you. 
You.
My hands are broken,
And time is going on and on, it goes forever (how long).
So I got high and lived all that life that I've taken all for granted.
Promise me you'll try.
To leave it all behind,
'cause I've elected hell,
Lying to myself.
Why have I gone blind.
Live another life.
You. You.
The only way out
Is letting your guard down and never die forgotten (I know).
Forgive me, my love,
I stand here all alone, and I can see the bottom.
Promise me you'll try.
To leave it all behind,
'cause I've elected hell,
Lying to myself.
Why have I gone blind.
Live another life.
You. You.
You. You.
You. You.
Evil Angel.
Hold it together, birds of a feather,
Nothing but lies and crooked wings.
I have the answer, spreading the cancer,
You are the faith inside me.
No, don't
Leave me to die here,
Help me survive here.
Alone, don't remember, remember.

Put me to sleep evil angel.
Open your wings evil angel.
A-ah.
I'm a believer,
Nothing could be worse,
All these imaginary friends.
Hiding betrayal,
Driving the nail,
Hoping to find a savior.
No, don't
Leave me to die here,
Help me survive here.
Alone, don't
Surrender, surrender.
Put me to sleep evil angel.
Open your wings evil angel.
Oh.
Fly over me evil angel.
Why can't I breathe evil angel.
Put me to sleep evil angel.
Open your wings evil angel.
Oh.
Fly over me evil angel.
Why can't I breathe evil angel. 
Until The End.
So clever,
Whatever,
I'm done with these endeavors.
Alone I walk the winding way.
(Here I stay)
It's over,
No longer,
I feel it growing stronger.
I'll live to die another day,
Until I fade away.
Why give up, why give in.
It's not enough, it never is.
So I will go on until the end.
We've become desolate.
It's not enough, it never is.
But I will go on until the end.
Surround me,
It's easy
To fall apart completely.
I feel you creeping up again.
In my head.
It's over,
No longer,
I feel it growing colder.
I knew this day would come to end,
So let this life begin.
Why give up, why give in.
It's not enough, it never is.
So I will go on until the end.
We've become desolate.
It's not enough, it never is.
But I will go on until the end.
I've lost my way.
I've lost my way, but I will go on until the end.
Living is hard enough
Without you fucking up.
Why give up, why give in.
It's not enough, it never is.
So I will go on until the end.
We've become desolate.
It's not enough, it never is.
But I will go on until the end.
I've lost my way.
I've lost my way, but I will go on until the end.
U-uh, u-uh.
The final fight I'll win,
The final fight I'll win,
The final fight I'll win,
But I will go on until the end. 
Dance With The Devil.
Here I stand, helpless and left for dead.
Close your eyes, so many days go by.
Easy to find what's wrong, harder to find what's right.
I believe in you, I can show you that I can see right through all your empty lies.
I won't stay long, in this world so wrong.
Say goodbye, as we dance with the devil tonight.
Don't you dare look at him in the eye, as we dance with the devil tonight.
Trembling, crawling across my skin.
Feeling your cold dead eyes, stealing the life of mine.
I believe in you, I can show you that I can see right through all your empty lies.
I won't last long, in this world so wrong.
Say goodbye, as we dance with the devil tonight.
Don't you dare look at him in the eye, as we dance with the devil tonight.
Hold on. Hold on.
Say goodbye, as we dance with the devil tonight.
Don't you dare look at him in the eye, as we dance with the devil tonight.
Hold on. Hold on.
Goodbye.
