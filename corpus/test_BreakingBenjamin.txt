Topless.
Fruit on the vine.
You've got yours,
And I've got mine.
Meat on your bones.
They won't know, they won't know.
I loathe your face, just get away.
I'm on my knees, fuck you, fuck me.
I'm on my way to feel you dislocate.
Safe in your space.
I'm open, wide open.
I loathe your face, just get away.
I'm on my knees, fuck you, fuck me.
Like me, like me, like me.
I loathe your face, just get away.
I'm on my knees, fuck you, fuck me.
Me, me, me.
Here We Are.
Sing it for me,
I can't erase the stupid things I say.
You're better than me,
I struggle just to find a better way.
So here we are, fighting and trying to hide the scars.
I'll be home tonight, take a breath and softly say goodbye.
The lonely road, the one that I should try to walk alone.
I'll be home tonight, take a breath and softly say goodbye.
You wouldn't like me.
Keep moving on until forever ends.
Don't try to fight me.
The beauty queen has lost her crown again.
So here we are, fighting and trying to hide the scars.
I'll be home tonight, take a breath and softly say goodbye.
The lonely road, the one that I should try to walk alone.
I'll be home tonight, take a breath and softly say goodbye.
goodbye.
So why are you so eager to betray.
Pick the pieces up, pick the pieces up.
So why are you the one that walks away.
Pick the pieces up, pick the pieces up, pick the pieces up.
O-oh.
So here we are, fighting and trying to hide the scars.
I'll be home tonight, take a breath and softly say goodbye.
The lonely road, the one that I should try to walk alone.
I'll be home tonight, take a breath and softly say goodbye.
Just take a breath and softly say goodbye.
Unknown Soldier.
Border line,
Dead inside.
I don't mind,
Falling to pieces.
Count me in, violent
Let's begin, feeding the sickness.
How do I simplify,
Dislocate - the enemy's on the way.
Show me what it's like
To dream in black and white,
So I can leave this world tonight.
Full of fear,
Ever clear.
I'll be here,
Fighting forever.
Curious,
Venomous,
You'll find me
Climbing to heaven.
Never mind,
Turn back time.
You'll be fine, I will get left behind.
Show me what it's like
To dream in black and white,
So I can leave this world tonight.
Holding on too tight.
Breathe the breath of life,
So I can leave this world behind.
It only hurts just once.
They're only broken bones.
Hide the hate inside.
Oh.
So I can leave this world behind
Show me what it's like
To dream in black and white,
So I can leave this world tonight.
Holding on too tight.
Breathe the breath of life,
So I can leave this world behind.
Had Enough.
Milk it for all it's worth.
Make sure you get there first.
The apple of your eye.
The rotten core inside.
We are all prisoners.
Things couldn't get much worse.
I've had it up to here, you know your end is near.
You had to have it all,
Well have you had enough.
You greedy little bastard,
You will get what you deserve.
When all is said and done,
I will be the one to leave you in the misery and hate what you've become.
Intoxicated eyes, no longer live that life.
You should have learned by now, I'll burn this whole world down.
I need some peace of mind, no fear of what's behind.
You think you've won this fight, you've only lost your mind.
You had to have it all,
Well have you had enough.
You greedy little bastard,
You will get what you deserve.
When all is said and done,
I will be the one to leave you in the misery and hate what you've become.
Hold me down I will live again.
Pull me out I will break it in.
Hold me down better in the end.
Hold me down.
You had to have it all,
Well have you had enough.
You greedy little bastard,
You will get what you deserve.
When all is said and done,
I will be the one to leave you in the misery and hate what you've become.
Heaven help you.
You Fight Me.
You fight me, flat on my lonely face I fell.
Finding in the end I live well.
In light of the life that I have found,
It's coming down.
I don't know what isn't real,
But it's easy
To beat me.
Suck it in.
Life is sink or swim.
Love is blinding, no surviving.
I don't know what I want to be yet.
But I can show that I need to see this.
No time for lies and empty fights.
I'm on your side.
Can we live a life of peace and happiness.
I don't think so.
No denying I am scared to lose the things I love.
I'm in control.
This is how, this is how it's going to end.
This is how, this is how it's going to end.
End.
Everyone is waiting here for everyone.
Leave me alone.
This is how, this is how it's going to end.
This is how, this is how it's going to end.
This is how, this is how it's going to end.
No.
This is how, this is how it's going to end.
I Wish I May.
Shove me under you again.
I can't wait for this to end.
Sober, empty in the head.
I know I can never win.
Why should I have to wait.
I'll just look the other way.
We left this land of shiny lights.
I wish I may, I wish I might.
When all these dreams have come to end.
You wish you were, you're not my friend.
I can see you suffocate.
I can find no other way.
Try to make you saturate.
I can be your enemy.
Why should I have to wait.
I'll just look the other way.
We left this land of shiny lights.
I wish I may, I wish I might.
When all these dreams have come to end.
You wish you were, you're not my friend.
Woah no.
We left this land of shiny lights.
I wish I may, I wish I might.
When all these dreams have come to end.
You wish you were, you're not my friend.
You said you'd love.
To see the end.
The long hard road.
That I have been.
When all these dreams have come to end.
You wish you were, you're not my friend.
Blind eyes shine bright.
Medicate.
I got somethin' up my sleeve.
I know you will cover me.
Inside out and in between.
I know you will cover me.
I've got bruises on my knees.
I know you will cover me.
Inside out and in between.
And I know you will cover me.
Run away.
Make hate.
And get laid.
And get laid.
You tie me up.
I've had enough.
So medicate.
Medicate.
I'm already incomplete.
I know you will cover me.
Looking by your empathy.
I know you will cover me.
I've been lyin' here for weeks.
I know you will cover me.
Inside out and in between.
And I know you will cover me.

Polyamorous.
The day has come to an end.
The sun is over my head.
My polyamorous friend.
You got me in a mess of trouble again.
So.
Just when you think that you're all right.
I'm calling out from the inside.
I never hurt anyone.
I never listen at all.
They've come to get me again.
The cloud is over my head.
My polyamorous friend.
You got me in a mess of trouble again.
So.
Just when you think that you're all right.
I'm calling out from the inside.

Let's go.
Skin.
Well I know you don't know the reason.
And it's cold, a sign of the season.
'Cause you're old, and battered and beaten.
And we'll grow, til we hit the ceiling, yeah.
Well I'll be better, get away.
Send a letter, bombs away.
You're covered in my skin.
I couldn't imagine anyone else.
I'm off for the weekend.
I couldn't imagine why you would save yourself.
Well it's gone and it's not returning.
And your clothes and pictures are burning.
'Cause you're old, and battered and beaten.
And we'll grow, til we hit the ceiling, yeah.
Well I'll be better, get away.
Send a letter, bombs away.
You're covered in my skin.

I know you'll live another day.

Water.
what's all this talk of a notion.
I'd rather drink from the ocean.
what did you mean when you said no.
I only want what is best for you.
but I won't ever let you drown.
no I won't ever let you down.
cause I am my enemy.
the water's up to the knee.
I never wanted nothin' from you.
yes I do, yes I do.
my engine's runnin' on dry.
my head's so fucked up inside.
shut up.
I know.
I said so.
there is no way to recover.
you told me there is no other.
the surface is getting hotter.
I'll shove your head under water.
but I won't ever let you drown.
no I won't ever let you down.
cause I am my enemy.
the water's up to the knee.
I never wanted nothin' from you.

shut up.
I know.
I said so.
Home.
I've got a little red bow.
And I bought it for you.
'Cause I know you're not fair.
I don't get it, oh well.
And you color my skin.
And the colors don't blend.
'Cause I'm gonna get you.
And your little dog too.
There's a yellow brick road.
That we follow back home.
'Cause I know you can't wait.
Your belligerent hate.
There's no place like home.
There's no place like home.
Like home.
I've, got a southern belle too.
And ruby red shoes.
With a body of straw.
Are you sick of it all.
There's a man made of tin.
With an oil can grin.
And I'm gonna get you.
And your little dog too.
There's a yellow brick road.
That we follow back home.
And I know you can't wait.
Your belligerent hate.
There's no place like home.
There's no place like home.
There's a little white porch.
And you wanted it so.
Can you let me go down.
To the end of the road.
In the black and the white.
A Technicolorful life.
Can I stand by your side.
We can make it alright.
Like home.
'Cause I'm home.
There's a little white porch.
And you wanted it so.
Can you let me go down.
To the end of the road.
In the black and the white.
A Technicolorful life.
Then another arrived.
It's a cowardly lion.
What I want from this world.
What I wanna resolve.
When I want you to stay.
So I want you to wait.
I don't wanna be bold.
I don't wanna be cold.
I don't wanna grow old.
I don't wanna go home.
Phase.
The light is dead in your eye.
So I'll keep living my life.
I only wanted to try.
To find my way back inside.
My imitation of life.
My litigation of life.
It's something easy to find.
Inside the shade of your eye.
Out of the ground I rise to grace.
Nobody knows it's just a phase.
Help me I'm out of breath again.
Nobody knows somewhere to make it go away.
Phase.
Phase.
Phase.
Phase.
I find it hard to decide.
The way to make up your mind.
Your lips are better than mine.
So you can kiss this goodbye.
My imitation of life.
My litigation of life.
It's something easy to find.
Inside the shade of your eye.
Out of the ground I rise to grace.
Nobody knows it's just a phase.
Help me I'm out of breath again.
Nobody knows somewhere to make it go away.
It's just a phase.
And I can't wait.
Phase.
Phase.
Phase.
I know.
I know.
I know.
It's just a fucking phase.
It's just a fucking phase.
I'm drained time to fake and delay.
Watch the penny drop.
Let it go up and in drop.
Then watch it roll.
Let's all mourn till.
I survive inside you.
No Games.
This game is over.
I'm mean and older.
You're coming closer.
Over and over.
My dear Brianna.
I need an answer.
What was the question.
I can't remember.
Would you, want to.
Feel the way that I do.
And I bend, to your will.
I've felatted myself.
Tied to the needle.
My drunk libido.
My nervous ego.
The faster we go.
You are an asshole.
King of the castle.
I am the meager.
Follow the leader.
Would you, want to.
Feel the way that I do.
And I bend, to your will.
I've felatted myself.
And I know that you don't.
Like the way that it goes.
We're all in, so begin.
Just remember: I win.
Sugarcoat.
It started again.
Claimin' a friend.
I couldn't be.
I've never been.
I'm all alone.
Out in the cold.
I'll never know.
Your sugarcoat.
You're ready to blow.
You're ready to go.
But I'll never know.
Your sugarcoat.
Is just as sweet as I am.
Look what you did.
Suck on your lies 'til your eyes turn red.
What did you say.
Willing to drown in a tidal wave.
Take me away.
Let me believe that you're on your way.
Look what you did.
Suck on your lies 'til your eyes turn red.
I'm on the floor.
Battered and bored.
You got a taste.
I can't ignore.
I'm all alone.
Out in the cold.
I'll never know.
Your sugarcoat.
You're ready to blow.
You're ready to go.
But I'll never know.
Your sugarcoat.
Is just as sweet as I am.
Look what you did.
Suck on your lies 'til your eyes turn red.
What did you say.
Willing to drown in a tidal wave.
Take me away.
Let me believe that you're on your way.
Look what you did.
Suck on your lies 'til your eyes turn red.
Look what you did.
Suck on your lies 'til your eyes turn red.
What did you say.
Willing to drown in a tidal wave.
Take me away.
Let me believe that you're on your way.
Look what you did.
Suck on your lies 'til your eyes turn red.
Red.
Your eyes are red.
Shallow Bay.
come on.
the sun will rise.
another time.
the colors blind.
your virgin eyes.
I'm so inclined.
to make you mine.
you're out of line.
and out of time.
and I float upon a shallow bay.
lift me up until the ground gives way.
I'm a California castaway.
I don't think you wanna fuck with me.
don't over kill.
this painless thrill.
it's bitter still.
your pretty pill.
you wait until.
you've had your fill.
I know you will.
I know you will.
and I float upon a shallow bay.
lift me up until the ground gives way.
I'm a California castaway.
I don't think you wanna fuck with me.
a shallow bay.
a shallow bay.
and I float upon a shallow bay.
lift me up until the ground gives way.
I'm a California castaway.
I don't think you wanna fuck with me.
and I float upon a shallow bay.
lift me up until the ground gives way.
I'm a California castaway.
I don't think you wanna fuck with me.
you live, you learn.
you live, you learn.
you live, you learn.
you live.
Forever.
Do you know that I could never leave you.
And you know I could never beat you.
In a fight, I could never fight you, nevermind, I will not forget you.
Can I stay alive forever.
Can I stay alive forever.
Can I stay alive forever.
Forever. can you feel a chemical reaction.
Because I feel a hideous.
Attraction could we share a poison apple.
Could it be maniacal and awful.
Can I stay alive forever.
Can I stay alive forever.
Can I stay alive forever.
Forever. forever.
Stay alive forever.
Forever.
Stay alive forever.
Stay alive forever.
Stay alive forever.
Stay alive forever.
