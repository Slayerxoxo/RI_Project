I'mma be that nail in your coffin.
Sayin' that I softened.
I was duckin' down to reload.
So you can save your petty explanations.
I don't have the patience.
Before you even say it I know.
You let your pride or your ego.
Talk slick to me, no.
That is not the way I get down.
And look at how you lose your composure.
Now let me show you.
Exactly how the breaking point sounds.
I wanna see you choke on your lies.
Swallow up your greed.
Suffer all alone in your misery.
Choke on your lies.
Swallow up your greed.
Suffer all alone in your misery.
What is it you want me to tell you.
I am not the failure.
I would rather live and let be.
But you came with the right kind of threat to.
Push me to let you.
No you can't intimidate me.
You disrespect me so clearly.
Now you better hear me.
That is not the way it goes down.
You did it to yourself and it's over.
Now let me show you.
Exactly how the breaking point sounds.
I wanna see you choke on your lies.
Swallow up your greed.
Suffer all alone in your misery.
Choke on your lies.
Swallow up your greed.
Suffer all alone in your misery.
I wanna see you choke on your lies.
Swallow up your greed.
Suffer all alone in your misery.
Choke on your lies.
Swallow up your greed.
Suffer all alone in your misery.
You did it to yourself.
You did it to yourself.
You did it to yourself.
You did it to yourself.
You did it to yourself.
You did it to yourself.
You did it to yourself.
You did it to yourself.
I wanna see you choke on your lies.
Swallow up your greed.
Suffer all alone in your misery.
Choke on your lies.
Swallow up your greed.
Suffer all alone in your misery.
